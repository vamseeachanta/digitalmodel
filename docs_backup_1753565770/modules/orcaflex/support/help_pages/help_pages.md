I am able to open the help page directly. You may need to reopen the application or sign out and back in.

Ah, that would make sense. Itâ€™s using IE. I turned off the enhanced security that is on by default on servers. Please try again.

Adam,

Can you look into why this is happening on the ANSYS03 and ANSYS04 servers please.
Vamsee got this message back from Orcina on this issue.

Dear Vamsee,

Some policy on your computer is blocking the javascript we use in the built-in help browser. You must contact your own IT service to look into this further.
In the meantime, I am glad to hear that you should be able to use the internet help until the local difficulty is resolved.
I hope that your IT service can assist you with the blockage.

Regards,
Colin Lewis.
Orcina,Ltd

Thanks,
Scott

Yes, I am able to access the default web help start file. So, the F1 does not work from the GUI.

Any further thoughts?

Dear Vamsee,

The OrcaFlex help uses mathjax to render equations in a well-presented way.

This error code is sometimes associated with javascript errors, so could your machines be blocking use of java in browsers?

Can you access the web help starting at https://www.orcina.com/webhelp/OrcaFlex/Default.htm ?

I hope that something here helps.

Regards,

Colin Lewis.

Dear Support Representative,

The help documentation is not accessible on my analysis machine.

However, on another machine with demo version, it is accessible. Please can you let us know why this error may happen on 1 machine?

Thank you,
Vamsee

Dusty,

Please can you help coordinate with IT to get the help directly on ANSYS04 (and also ANSYS03). Currently I can get help documents open on my computer but not on ANSYS servers 03, 04. See error below.
