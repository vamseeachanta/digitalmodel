Ian,

Thank you for the prompt response. I got an idea from your example how I can handle multiple files.

I prepared an extended example with multiple files which might be useful for someone else. And this attached example is working as expected.

Thank you,
Vamsee

Hello Vamsee You can choose to use IncludeFile instead of BaseFile if you wish. I’ve attached a very simple model that shows how this would work. In the zip there are two yml files (staticmodel. yml and dynamicparamaters. yml). The dynamicparameters. yml

Hello Vamsee

You can choose to use IncludeFile instead of BaseFile if you wish.

I’ve attached a very simple model that shows how this would work. In the zip there are two yml files (staticmodel.yml and dynamicparamaters.yml). The dynamicparameters.yml file uses IncludeFile to load the staticmodel.yml in then changes the static damping values, like you show in your email below.

Best Regards
