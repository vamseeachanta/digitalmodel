# Introduction

To help perform tasks of installations

# Summary


- Design structure
- Ensure good distribution
- Locate CoG
- Organize equipment 
- Select best lifting locations
- Design lifting gear (slings, shackles, etc.)





- Implement any basic hand calculations
- 


## Go-by Guidance

- Use the following as a guideline for reviewing installation results
    - DAF at the hoook (eg 1.8) is typically less than DAF in the slings (eg: 2.5)
- Slings criteria can be based on the rigging nuances such as softeye vs. hard eye, etc. Shackles used etc.

## Design

Static design based on structure orientation and sling lengths can be implemented.

## Analysis

QA of model:
- Structure
    - Wet weight
    - Dry weight
    - Center of gravity    
- Tension on slings vs. total weight of structure


### Splash zone lowering

### Landing analysis

### Resonance analysis

For resonance or modal analysis, the following are the analysis steps:
- The following are the key inputs:
    - tba
    - tba
- The modal analysis is run according to the matrix and results are obtained
- Boundary Condition discussion:
    - If the structure has "All" six dofs to be solved for modal analysis, the axial modes will require higher lastMode to be specified.
    - If the structure has "X, Y, Z" dofs to be solved for modal analysis, the axial modes will require relatively lower lastMode to be specified.
- The results are reviewed for the following:
    - tba
    - tba

For QA of results, a hand calculation is also performed and overlapped with the charts.

20 years ago my lifting guide was the famous the Det Norske Vertas (DNV) VMO written 1996 ,
in the recent years DNV released a very good and modern H series for lifting. 
the newly established LEEA (Lifting Equipment Engineers association ) pocket book back in 2005.
