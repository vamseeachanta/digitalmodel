A ???????????? ?????????? ???????? can reduce mooring line loads for floating wind platform by up to ????% ?????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????????????????, dramatically lowering the Levelised Cost of Energy (????????). 
This work represents multiple years of innovation and collaboration, and we hope to inspire more researchers to explore this promising direction. Link to this new paper: https://lnkd.in/ezcfKypn

?? ?????? ???????????????????? & ??????????????????????????:
 ? ?? ????????: The idea was born in a discussion with Dimitris Stagonas, leading to a project supported by Supergen Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Hub ECR.
 ? ?? ????????: Built the ?????????? ?????????????????? with Dimitris Stagonas, MSc students Apostolos Koutras and Fatih Mehmet Topal, presenting initial findings at ???????????????????? ????????.
 ? ?? ????????-????????: Postdoc Researcher Dr Junxian Wang led cutting-edge CFD modelling, with results showcased at Torque 2024
 ? ?? Main lab contributions from Dr jingru xing (PhD research 2020-2024), MSc student Ninad Vaidya (experiment for regular waves, 2022?2023), and MSc student Ashkan Matin (experiment for irregular waves, 2023?2024).
 ? ?? Dr Nicholas Townsend brought expertise in wave energy systems, while Prof. Lei Zuo provided insights into wave and floating wind coupling, supported by the Cranfield International Collaboration Grant.

?? Support & Recognition:
This work has been made possible with funding from ???????? and the ???????????? ?????????????????? ???????? (??????).

 I?m incredibly grateful for the dedication and creativity of everyone involved in advancing renewable energy. Let?s continue to ???????? ?????? ???????????????????? ???? ???????????????????? ?????? ?? ?????????????????????? ????????????!


So cool to see the many different applications of foils in the marine environment lately. Foiling ferries, wavefoil for fuel consumption reduction, e-foils, sailing GP and now this.
