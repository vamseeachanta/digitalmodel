WEC Sim Applications - Contains collections of several WEC-Sim applications. Each application is a complete WEC-Sim model that can be run using the WEC-Sim MATLAB toolbox. The applications are organized by the type of WEC device and the type of analysis. The applications are intended to be used as examples for new users to learn how to use WEC-Sim and as templates for experienced users to build their own models.

This link can also include example AQWA models etc.
