# Introduction

To model umbilical end:
    - using 6D buoy
    - and start at appropriate initial position and orientation

## Summary

Under construction

## Results

### Static

- Steps
    - Automate modelling
- Extract action (or system inputs) and response quantities
    - Present results in tabular form
    - Present summary in tabular form
    - Present plots to explain trends (and identify erroneous results)

### Dynamic

- Run critical steps
- Extract results 
- Generate weather windows
    - Based on acceptance criteria
    - Plot trends and identify limits
    - Utilize pymvli package. Transfer this to assetutilities?
    - Present results in tabular format (and graphs)
