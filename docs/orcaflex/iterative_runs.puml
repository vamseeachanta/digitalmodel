    note right
        Objective: To streamline (and automate) iterative analysis. 
        Examples are:
         - Umbilical installation steps with calculated positions
         - difficult convergence runs
         - etc

                  to help convergence
                Select json "keys" used to save
                Purpose: to help rerun with change in positions
