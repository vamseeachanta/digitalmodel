# Introduction

To help QA RAOs

# Summary

- Check displacement RAOs
    - Utilize long seas RAOs criteria
    - Compare betwen RAOs 
- Check seastate RAOs by plotting
    - Compare RAOs 
        - at different locations (Extremes and middle)
        - at different wave frequencies
        - at different wave directions
        - Between different RAOs
