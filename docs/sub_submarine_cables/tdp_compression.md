Snake Effect, Compressive Waves, and Buckling Mysteries in Subsea Cable Installation 🐍

If you’ve ever worked with subsea power cables, umbilicals, or flexibles, chances are you’ve either heard of—or argued about—the “snake effect.”

Whether you call it compressive waves, local buckling, or numerical weirdness, this phenomenon is one of the most debated topics both in engineering offices and offshore briefings.

🚢 The Core Issue
During cable or flexible installation, most challenges arise in the touchdown zone—the part of the cable where it meets the seabed. 

When the vessel heaves downward too quickly, the cable cannot respond fast enough—leading to axial compression. Depending on the cross sectional properties of the cable, the hydrodynamics and the laying scenario itself this can result in a dramatic buckling effect—a snake-like shape slithering in the touchdown zone.

👀 But does this actually happen offshore?
 Some say: “Only once every three hours.”
 Others swear their ROV caught it on camera.
 Some dismiss it as a “numerical artifact.”
 
📊 One topic which often comes up in discussions is the relationship between residual tension and the resulting maximum compression. 

This is visualised in the video below. All cables are exposed to the same dynamics and are not interfereing with each other: 

5kN residual tension ➝ compression of 5kN
10kN ➝ compression increases to 8kN
20kN ➝ compression increases to 10kN
40kN ➝ no compression at all

Turns out, increasing residual tension doesn’t always reduce compression. Not unless it crosses a critical threshold. This might be contrary to the gut feeling... 

💬 Your turn!
Have you seen the snake effect in real life?
Do you believe the predictions from your simulation tools?
What do you think are the governing parameters for this effect?
Got any ROV footage? Got a good story from deck? Let’s hear it.
