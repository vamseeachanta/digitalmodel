### Coating and Cathodic Protection

Ship Hulls require protection from both corrosion and the development of biofouling accumulations. The former is achieved by both coating and cathodic protection systems and the latter by antifouling coatings. In addition to the basic costs of the coating and cathodic protection systems, allowances must be made for dry dock costs, loss of revenue, and increased fuel consumption and lost performance due to the increase in skin friction drag caused by poor hull maintenance and biofouling.
