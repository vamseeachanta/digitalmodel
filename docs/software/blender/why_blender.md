SO MANY 3D artists switched to Blender last year.

The reason? It wasn't just about the price tag.

Here's what I discovered after 3+ years in 3D:

Traditional industry tools are losing ground, and here's why:

1. Learning curve
Maya: 2-3 years to master basics
Blender: 6-8 months for same proficiency

2. Community support
Maya: Limited forums, paid tutorials
Blender: 12M+ active users sharing knowledge

3. Innovation speed
Maya: Annual updates
Blender: Monthly improvements driven by community

But the real game-changer?

Blender's interface makes sense.

Example: I taught my 15-year-old nephew basic modeling.
→ Maya: Gave up after 2 weeks
→ Blender: Created his first character in 10 days

The industry is noticing:

- Netflix now accepts Blender files
- Ubisoft adopted it for concept art
- Disney uses it for previs

Want to know the most surprising part?

Major studios are contributing to Blender's development.

Epic Games invested $1.2M
Adobe pitched in $10M
Unity added another $1M

Why?

Because they see what we see:

The future of 3D is community-driven.

Not corporate-controlled.
