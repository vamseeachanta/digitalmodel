# Introduction to Metocean

Metocean is a term used to describe the meteorological and oceanographic conditions that affect offshore operations. These conditions include wind, waves, currents, tides, and water temperature. Metocean data is used to design offshore structures

## Why is Metocean important?

Metocean data is critical for the design and operation of offshore structures. It is used to determine the loads that structures will be subjected to, as well as the environmental conditions that will affect the safety and performance of the structure. Metocean data is also used to assess the risks associated with offshore operations, and to develop strategies to mitigate those risks.
