## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Data Structures

**CatenaryInput** (dataclass):
- `length`: Unstretched line length [m]
- `horizontal_span`: Horizontal distance [m]
- `vertical_span`: Vertical distance [m]
- `weight_per_length`: Submerged weight [N/m]
- `ea_stiffness`: Axial stiffness EA [N]
- `water_depth`: Optional water depth [m]
- `seabed_friction`: Optional friction coefficient

**CatenaryResults** (dataclass):
- `horizontal_tension`: H component [N]
- `vertical_tension_fairlead`: V at fairlead [N]
- `total_tension_fairlead`: Total T at fairlead [N]
- `total_tension_anchor`: Total T at anchor [N]
- `elongation`: Elastic stretch [m]
- `touchdown_distance`: Distance to seabed [m]
- `catenary_parameter`: a = H/w [m]
- `shape_x`, `shape_y`: Line shape arrays
- `tension_distribution`: Tension along line
- `converged`: Solver convergence flag
- `iterations`: Number of iterations

### 2. Catenary Solver Class

**Mathematical Implementation**:
- Classical catenary equations: `y(x) = a * cosh(x/a) - a`
- Arc length formula: `s(x) = a * sinh(x/a)`
- Elastic elongation: `e = H * L / EA`
- Tension distribution: `T(x) = sqrt(H² + (w*y)²)`

**Numerical Methods**:
- Primary: Newton-Raphson with analytical derivative
- Fallback: Brent's method (bracketing)
- Convergence tolerance: 1e-6 m (configurable)
- Maximum iterations: 100 (configurable)

**Features**:
- Input validation
- Analytical derivatives for fast convergence
- Robust fallback solver
- Touchdown point calculation
- Line shape generation (100 points)
- Tension distribution calculation

### 3. Key Methods

- `solve(params)`: Main solver method
- `_compute_results()`: Calculate all output quantities
- `_calculate_touchdown()`: Inverse catenary for seabed contact

## Current Status

### What Works

- Data structures properly defined
- Input validation
- Length error function correctly implemented
- Analytical derivative calculation
- Solver convergence (both Newton-Raphson and Brent)
- Result computation
- Elastic elongation calculation
- Shape and tension distribution generation
- Touchdown point calculation

### Known Issues

**CRITICAL**: The current implementation solves a 1D problem (length constraint only) but the actual catenary problem is 2D (both horizontal AND vertical span must be satisfied).

**Current Behavior**:
- Solver finds H that satisfies: `arc_length + elongation = total_length`
- Does NOT verify that the resulting vertical displacement matches `vertical_span`

**Required Fix**:
The solver needs to solve a coupled 2D problem where:
1. Horizontal projection at fairlead = `horizontal_span`
2. Vertical projection at fairlead = `vertical_span`
3. Arc length + elongation = `length`

This requires either:
- 2D Newton-Raphson solving for (H, anchor_position)
- Sequential iteration approach
- Using both horizontal and vertical geometry constraints

**Excel Reference Comparison**:
- Current results: H ≈ 1,327,168 N
- Excel reference: H ≈ 785,000 N
- Error: ~69% (exceeds ±1% target)

### Test Results

**Test Coverage**:
- ✓ Data class creation
- ✓ Solver convergence
- ✓ Basic catenary properties
- ✓ Pythagorean theorem verification
- ✓ Catenary parameter calculation
- ✓ Elastic elongation formula
- ✓ Tension monotonicity
- ✗ Excel reference validation (fails due to 2D issue)

## Next Steps to Complete Implementation

### Priority 1: Fix 2D Solver (REQUIRED)

**Approach A - Full 2D Solver**:
```python
def solve_2d(self, params):
    # Solve for (H, x_anchor) such that:
    # 1. fairlead_x - x_anchor = horizontal_span
    # 2. fairlead_y - y_anchor = vertical_span
    # 3. arc_length + elongation = length
    pass
```

**Approach B - Iterative with Geometry**:
```python
# Use vertical span constraint:
# At fairlead: y = a * (cosh(x/a) - 1) = vertical_span
# This gives additional constraint on H
```

### Priority 2: Validation

- Fix solver to match Excel reference within ±1%
- Run full test suite
- Validate against multiple test cases
- Performance benchmarking

### Priority 3: Documentation

- Update docstrings with corrected formulation
- Add usage examples
- Create integration guide
- Document limitations

### Priority 4: Enhancements

- Multi-segment support (from spec)
- Seabed interaction
- Current effects
- 3D catenary (future)

## Conclusion

The catenary solver has been **substantially implemented** with clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, and proper numerical methods. The core issue is that the current implementation solves a 1D problem (length constraint) when it needs to solve a 2D problem (length + vertical geometry constraints).

**Estimated Effort to Complete**:
- Fix 2D solver: 2-4 hours
- Validation & testing: 1-2 hours
- Documentation updates: 1 hour
- **Total: 4-7 hours**

The foundation is solid and ready for the final refinement to match the Excel reference behavior.

**Implementation Status**: Core complete, requires 2D solver refinement for production use.
