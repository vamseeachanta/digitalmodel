# Phase 2: Equipment Catalog Scraping Strategy

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** üìã Planning
**Previous Phase:** [Phase 1 - Vessel Database Scraping](./WEB_SCRAPING_FINDINGS.md)

---

## Executive Summary

After completing Phase 1 (vessel scraping) and validating the Selenium framework, Phase 2 focuses on **equipment catalog scraping** where manufacturer websites offer better data availability than vessel databases.

**Key Advantage:** Equipment manufacturers typically publish detailed product catalogs with specifications on their websites, making them more scrapable than proprietary vessel databases.

## Current Equipment Baseline

### Existing Data (as of 2025-10-25)

| Category | Files | Size | Coverage |
|----------|-------|------|----------|
| **Fenders** | 29 PDFs | 74MB | ‚úÖ Comprehensive (design manuals, specs) |
| **Buoys** | 1 PDF | 7.1MB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (SFT brochure only) |
| **Anchors** | 1 image | 264KB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Very limited |
| **Injector Heads** | ~5 PDFs | 3.8MB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited manufacturers |
| **Manifolds** | Unknown | 300KB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited |
| **SPM** | Text docs | 16KB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact info only |
| **X-Trees** | Unknown | 1.8MB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited |

**Gaps Identified:**
- Anchors: Need specifications for various types (Hall, Delta, Drag embedment)
- Buoys: Need additional manufacturers beyond SFT
- SPM: Need technical specifications, not just contact info
- All categories: Need 2024-2025 updated specifications

---

### Priority 4: SPM (Single Point Mooring) üîß **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Rationale:** Current data is just contact info, need technical specs

**Target Sources:**
- Technical documentation from major SPM manufacturers
- Engineering specifications
- Cost estimation databases (if publicly available)

**Expected Data:**
- SPM system configurations
- Capacity ratings
- Installation requirements
- Maintenance specifications
- Environmental limits

---

## Scraping Framework Reuse

### Existing Framework (from Phase 1)
‚úÖ **BaseScraper** - HTTP handling, rate limiting, retry logic
‚úÖ **DynamicScraper** - Selenium for JavaScript content
‚úÖ **DataValidator** - Quality scoring and validation
‚úÖ **CLI Interface** - Command-line execution

### New Components Needed

**EquipmentScraper (Base Class)**
```python
class EquipmentScraper(BaseScraper):
    """Base scraper for equipment manufacturer catalogs."""

    def standardize_equipment_specs(self, df: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
        """Standardize equipment specifications across manufacturers."""
        # Common fields: product_name, type, dimensions, capacity, material, etc.
        pass

    def extract_pdf_catalog_links(self, html: str) -> List[str]:
        """Extract PDF catalog download links."""
        pass

    def validate_equipment_specs(self, df: DataFrame) -> Dict:
        """Validate equipment specifications completeness."""
        pass
```

**Specialized Scrapers:**
- `FenderScraper(EquipmentScraper)` - Fender-specific logic
- `AnchorScraper(EquipmentScraper)` - Anchor-specific logic
- `BuoyScraper(EquipmentScraper)` - Buoy-specific logic
- `SPMScraper(EquipmentScraper)` - SPM-specific logic

- **Validation:** Quality score ‚â• 75/100

### Expected Outcomes
- **Fenders:** +200 product specifications from 5+ manufacturers
- **Anchors:** +100 anchor specifications (50kg to 40 tonnes range)
- **Buoys:** +50 buoy specifications from 3+ manufacturers
- **SPM:** +20 SPM system specifications

### Framework Benefits

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- **Fender scraping**: Manufacturers publish detailed specs online
- **Framework reuse**: Phase 1 framework proven to work
- **Data availability**: Multiple sources per category

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Dynamic content**: Some sites may require Selenium (already available)
- **PDF extraction**: May need additional parsing for some catalogs
- **Standardization**: Different manufacturers use different formats

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use Selenium framework for dynamic sites
- Implement manufacturer-specific parsers where needed
- Focus on web tables first, PDFs as secondary source
- Manual validation for critical specifications

## Comparison: Vessels vs Equipment

| Factor | Vessel Databases (Phase 1) | Equipment Catalogs (Phase 2) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Free Sources** | ‚ùå Scarce | ‚úÖ Abundant (manufacturer sites) |
| **Data Quality** | ‚ö†Ô∏è 73-88% missing | ‚úÖ Expected 80%+ complete |
| **Freshness** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Often outdated | ‚úÖ Current manufacturer specs |
| **Scraping Difficulty** | üî¥ High (paywalls, AJAX) | üü¢ Low (public catalogs) |
| **Framework Reuse** | ‚úÖ Static + Selenium | ‚úÖ Static + Selenium |
| **Expected ROI** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (need commercial) | ‚úÖ High (comprehensive free data) |

**Conclusion:** Equipment scraping (Phase 2) has **significantly better prospects** than vessel scraping (Phase 1) due to manufacturer websites publishing specifications openly for marketing purposes.
