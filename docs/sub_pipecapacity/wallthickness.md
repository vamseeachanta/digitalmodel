Wall Thickness

So we’ve establish that DNV is more suitable and adapt for Offshore Environments than ASME


Wall Thickness = Tonnage of Steel x $/kg (i.e. #capex of Project), so let’s go through the selection of a subsea #pipeline wall thickness based on DNV-ST-F101, involves several key steps:

1. Design Conditions Assessment:
- Establish the environmental and operational conditions at the pipeline location, including factors like water depth, seabed conditions, temperature, pressure, and the properties of the fluid being transported.

2. Material Selection (API 5L X65 !!!! ✋ BS)
- Select material for the pipeline, considering factors like corrosion resistance, mechanical properties, sour service, qualification and weldability.

3. Wall Thickness Calculation:
- Perform wall thickness calculations using the formulae and guidelines provided in DNV-ST-F101 to determine the minimum required wall thickness for the pipeline.

4. Buckling and Stability Analysis:
- Assess the pipeline's stability against external factors like lateral buckling and upheaval buckling. These analyses may influence the wall thickness.

5. Installation Conditions:
- Consider the installation process and any mechanical or thermal effects that may require additional wall thickness for protection during installation, we will get into the Installation part in the next few posts

A brief overview of how we calculate the minimum required Wall Thickness for Subsea pipelines:

1. Burst:
- Burst refers to the failure of a pipeline due to excessive internal pressure. It occurs when the pressure inside the pipeline exceeds its design limits, causing the material to rupture or burst. This can lead to the release of the contents or a hazardous situation.

2. Collapse:
- Collapse, on the other hand, is the failure of a pipeline due to excessive external pressure or vacuum. When the external pressure exceeds the structural integrity of the vessel or pipeline, it can cause deformation, buckling, or collapse. Collapse can lead to loss of containment and structural damage.

3 .Buckle propagation:
- often referred to as "propagating buckling," is a phenomenon that can occur in pipelines or structures, particularly in subsea or offshore applications. It involves the growth or propagation of a buckling or deformation along the length of a pipeline.

In the design and engineering of pipelines, it's crucial to consider factors like material strength, thickness, safety margins, and operating conditions to prevent burst and collapse and ensure effective containment.

Disclaimer: Above is just a brief, as the Wall Thickness also at time need to consider Stability of the Pipeline and Buckling or other factors

### Other notes

In my humble opinion is, both DNV and ASME serve their own purposes. DNV is practical for offshore where costs are very high and every mm of WT saves lots of money. DNV design basis is more strain based than traditional designs of ASME with higher safety margins. Offshore pipelines are remote hence any failure will not have direct threat to safety. Whereas any failure to onshore pipelines may have more safety implications and higher safety factor may beneficial.


Ahmed, What the industry needs going forward is an Asset Digital Twin which you can trust and with proper 3rd party independent verification and assurance that can provide life cycle asset integrity management predictions via approved Digital Twin Simulations compliant with DNV RP A 204 ....
