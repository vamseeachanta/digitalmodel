## Basic Model Checks

THe basic model checks

### Summary

### Hydrostatic

Weight, Gyradii etc. Stability is part of ANSYS and will need to be checked to ensure runs are as expected.

### Hydrodynamic

- Do zero and check all loads in all structures
  - X, Y and Z starting positions
  - find the equilibrium position and specify utilze for zero load
  - Check the structure loads

- X, Y and Z starting positions

### External Force Analysis

- Why do we get 4 values at each time step. Should we take the final time step iteration value as the main value.
