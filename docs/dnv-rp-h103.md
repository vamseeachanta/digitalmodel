# Introduction

To evaluate hydrodynamic properties for structures based on shapes for modelling and analysis in marine operations



# Summary


# Rectangular

- Based on **plate** structure. 
- height of structure is flow direction 
- the structure breadth & width determines the hydrodynamic properties
- Added mass 
    - ratio is b/a or breadth/width
    - Value is added mass coefficient, Ca
- Drag coefficient
    - ratio is b/width
    - value is Cd

# Cylinder

- Length of cylinder is flow direction 
- Added mass 
    - ratio is length/diameter
    - Value is added mass coefficient, Ca
- Drag coefficient
    - ratio is length/diameter
    - value is Cd
