Burst testing is fun. And even more fun when it highly correlates with the analysis model. The burst test below was a part of a study that Stressman Engineering conducted together with NIRAS - Induction Bending. The pipe was measured, before and after bending, at every 100mm around the circumferential. 

Then the 3D model was lofted based on these measurements. The material was 22Cr duplex (UNS31803), and material tests of the same batch was performed both inside and outside the heat affected zone. 

The pipe bursted at the location we anticipated. For information, the wall thickness of the extrados was thinner than the burst location. 

Our findings in general was as long as you use code formulas from ASME (The American Society of Mechanical Engineers) B31.3 you are on the safe side. These formulas match very well with our study.
