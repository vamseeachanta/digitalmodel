### 1. Frequency Response Curves
**File:** `frequency_response_curves.png`

Shows added mass (solid red) and damping (dashed blue) coefficients as functions of wave frequency for all six DOF:
- Surge (1,1)
- Sway (2,2)
- Heave (3,3)
- Roll (4,4)
- Pitch (5,5)
- Yaw (6,6)

**Key Insights:**
- Added mass decreases with increasing frequency
- Damping exhibits peaks near resonance frequencies
- Each DOF has distinct frequency response characteristics

### 2. Critical Damping Ratios
**File:** `critical_damping_ratios.png`

Bar chart showing damping ratio (Î¶) for each degree of freedom at reference frequency (Ï‰ â‰ˆ 1.0 rad/s).

**Color Coding:**
- ðŸ”´ Red: Î¶ < 0.05 (Highly underdamped)
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: 0.05 â‰¤ Î¶ < 0.1 (Underdamped)
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Î¶ â‰¥ 0.1 (Well damped)

**Typical Values:**
- Î¶ < 0.05: Potential for resonance amplification
- Î¶ = 1.0: Critical damping (optimal for motion control)
- Î¶ > 1.0: Overdamped (sluggish response)

## Data Interpretation

### Degrees of Freedom (DOF)

| DOF | Motion Type | Index |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| Surge | Longitudinal translation | 1 |
| Sway | Lateral translation | 2 |
| Heave | Vertical translation | 3 |
| Roll | Rotation about longitudinal axis | 4 |
| Pitch | Rotation about lateral axis | 5 |
| Yaw | Rotation about vertical axis | 6 |

### Matrix Notation

- **A_ij**: Added mass coefficient (i-th force due to j-th acceleration)
- **B_ij**: Damping coefficient (i-th force due to j-th velocity)

**Symmetry:**
- Diagonal terms (A_ii, B_ii): Direct coefficients
- Off-diagonal terms (A_ij, B_ij): Coupling coefficients
- Matrices are typically symmetric (A_ij = A_ji)
