### Introduction

### Steps

To import data from an Aqwa solver input file:

- Create a new Workbench project and add a a Hydrodynamic Diffraction system, and any linked Hydrodynamic Response systems as required, to the Project Schematic.

- Attach a geometry, or a dummy geometry, to the system and open the Aqwa editor.
  - Can we suppress existing geometry and only keep other geometry?

- Perform analysis.
