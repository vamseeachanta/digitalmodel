## Introduction

Process to define external force

## External Force

Node position, velocity etc. in X and Y Direction
Calculate the forces in X and Y
Apply back to the node.

- Run using a regular wave input to the ship
  - Check results (i.e. X,Y force on the mooring via X,Y velocity of the node)

### Develop Code

- Utilize virtual environment to test the python code
- Test the code with another function.
- Wireup AQWA node/variables to the forces

### Way Forward

- Create a Python3 server (more flexibility). But many things have to be changed.
  - I am assuming we have to use Python2 server (i.e. Python.exe) for our AqwaServerMgr is primary Python 2. Going to Python 3 requires some handling of another python 3 virtual environment/server etc.? However, wanted to hear from the professionals.
