# Introduction

- Ship is a steel structure and will need be protected from Corrosion
- To prevent/mitigate/minimize corrosion from occuring cathodic protection is required.
- If a ship is coated, is cathodic protection (Anodes or ICCP) required? Yes
  - Even if coated efficiently, there can be presence of holidays during the initial paining
  - Due to the dynamic nature of these structures, there can be areas of damage that needs to be protected which can be done using minimal cathodic protection
  - This minimal cathodic protection will also provide insurance against any coating failures

## Design Data

#### Salinity

Salinity Calculations

3.5% Salinity = 35,000 ppm = 35 ppt
**Unit Definitions**

- ppt parts per thousand
- ppm parts per million
- % parts per hundred
- therefore, 1 ppm = 0.001 ppt = 0.0001 % or (parts per hundred)

**example data of seawater at a location, Temperature is ?:**
Salinity 0.1ppt =  0.21  mS/cm = 4762  Ohm.cm
Salinity 1.0ppt = 1.970 mS/cm = 507.6 Ohm.cm
Salinity 10ppt  = 17.02 mS/cm = 58.75 Ohm.cm
Salinity 25ppt  = 39.26 mS/cm = 25.47 Ohm.cm
Salinity 31ppt  = 47.62 mS/cm = 21.00 Ohm.cm
