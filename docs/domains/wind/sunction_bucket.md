What an amazing view of SBJ! ??

Today, we welcome the first batch of suction bucket jacket foundations (SBJs) at the Port of Taichung from Korea!

These impressive structures stand around 80 meters tall and weigh up to 2,300 tonnes each for our 920 MW Greater Changhua 2b and 4 offshore wind farms. Built with steel cylinders pre-attached to jacket braces, they allow for faster, pile-free installation with minimal noise impact?making them one of the most eco-friendly foundation technologies out there. ??
 
There will be more heavy components arriving in Taiwan. Stay tuned for more and the latest progress on the Greater Changhua 2b and 4 offshore wind farms!
