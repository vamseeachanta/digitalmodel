# Analysis Modules

> Analysis modules, engineering references, and computational tools
>
> Consolidated from docs/eng/ and docs/domains/ (Feb 2026)

## Overview

Analysis modules and computational tools for specific engineering calculations, plus engineering reference materials consolidated from the former `docs/eng/` directory. These modules provide reusable components for complex analysis workflows.

**Key Areas:**
- **Analysis**: Core calculation engines and algorithms (aqwa, orcaflex, orcawave, fem)
- **Engineering Domains**: Drilling, structural, fatigue, risers, mooring, subsea, wind
- **References**: Standards, field development, materials, and general O&G references
- **Visualization**: Plotting, reporting, and data presentation
- **Data Processing**: Import/export, transformation, and validation
