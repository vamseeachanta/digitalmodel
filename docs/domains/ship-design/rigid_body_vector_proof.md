# Rigid Body Motion: Linear Acceleration Transformation Independence

## Problem Statement
Show that for rigid body motion, transforming linear acceleration from point A to B is equivalent to transforming from point C to B, demonstrating the path-independence of acceleration transformations.

## Mathematical Proof

### Setup
Consider a rigid body undergoing general motion (translation + rotation). Let's examine the linear acceleration **a** at different points in the body.

**Key Points:**
- Point A: Reference point A in the rigid body
- Point B: Target point B in the rigid body  
- Point C: Alternative reference point C in the rigid body
- **a**: Linear acceleration vector
- **α**: Angular acceleration vector
- **ω**: Angular velocity vector

### Case 1: Transformation A → B

For a rigid body in general motion, the acceleration at point B relates to point A by:
```
a_B = a_A + α × r_AB + ω × (ω × r_AB)
```

Where:
- **a_B** = linear acceleration at point B
- **a_A** = linear acceleration at point A
- **α** = angular acceleration vector
- **ω** = angular velocity vector
- **r_AB** = position vector from A to B

### Case 2: Transformation C → B

Similarly, transforming from point C to point B:
```
a_B = a_C + α × r_CB + ω × (ω × r_CB)
```

Where:
- **a_C** = linear acceleration at point C
- **r_CB** = position vector from C to B

### Case 3: Transformation A → C

We can also relate points A and C:
```
a_C = a_A + α × r_AC + ω × (ω × r_AC)
```

Where **r_AC** = position vector from A to C.

### Proof of Equivalence

**Step 1:** Substitute the A→C transformation into the C→B transformation:
```
a_B = a_C + α × r_CB + ω × (ω × r_CB)
a_B = [a_A + α × r_AC + ω × (ω × r_AC)] + α × r_CB + ω × (ω × r_CB)
a_B = a_A + α × r_AC + α × r_CB + ω × (ω × r_AC) + ω × (ω × r_CB)
```

**Step 2:** Group similar terms:
```
a_B = a_A + α × (r_AC + r_CB) + ω × [ω × (r_AC + r_CB)]
```

**Step 3:** Use vector addition property:
Since **r_AC** + **r_CB** = **r_AB** (vector triangle closure):
```
a_B = a_A + α × r_AB + ω × (ω × r_AB)
```

**Step 4:** This is identical to the direct A→B transformation!

### Key Components of Acceleration Transformation

The transformation includes two terms:

1. **α × r**: Tangential acceleration due to angular acceleration
2. **ω × (ω × r)**: Centripetal acceleration due to rotation

Both terms follow the same path-independence principle.

### Examples in Rigid Body Systems:
- **Rotating machinery**: Acceleration of any point can be found relative to any reference
- **Vehicle dynamics**: Wheel acceleration relative to chassis center vs. engine mount
- **Robotic arms**: Joint accelerations independent of reference point choice

### Physical Interpretation

The mathematical result reflects that:
- Rigid body motion is characterized by unique **α** and **ω** vectors
- Acceleration relationships depend only on relative positions between points
- The choice of intermediate reference point doesn't affect the final acceleration

### Conclusion

**∴ Acceleration Transformation A→B ≡ Acceleration Transformation C→B**

This proves that for rigid body motion, linear acceleration transformations are **path-independent**, regardless of which intermediate reference point is chosen within the rigid body.
