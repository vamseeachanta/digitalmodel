# Offshore Pipeline Installation Design Code

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines and best practices for the design and installation of offshore pipelines. It covers various aspects including planning, design, material selection, and installation procedures.

## Summary

## Feasiblity

Objective: The installation of a given pipeline is feasible with the available typical installation vessels.

Scope:
a/ Basecase method:

- The idea is to perform hand calculations for rigid pipeline for varying DAFs (~1.1 to 1.5 factors)
- We can also add typical vessels, installation capabilities (and historical installations) from installation contractors (going through brochures).
- Ideally historical installations in offshore Mexico (similar Gulf of Mexico weather) if we can get our hands on it.
b/ Alternatively, I have OrcaFlex license and can perform  installation analysis with 3-4 weeks of budget (if required).

I prefer the basecase method above as it will give us a more generic method to address for all jobs. Anyways, we can use combination of literature survey and analysis software and beef up our outcomes into a document for future projects.

Outlined the typical installation behavior for both Rigid and power cables. For the feasibility study, the following aspects may be considered:

Objective: The installation of a given pipeline is feasible with the available typical installation vessels.

For the feasibility study, the following aspects are considered:

Rigid pipelines:

- At the vessel interface (e.g. stinger angle, articulated stinger, etc.)
  - Tension: The expected tension DAF is of the order of 1.1 to 1.2 times.
  - The bending moment DAF is typically 1.1 to 1.2 times. The installation angle can be altered to reduce the bending moment.
- At the seabed interface (e.g. touchdown zone etc.)
  - The expected tension DAF and/or compression may play a role.
  - The bending moment DAF is typically 1.2 to 1.4 times. Analysis will be performed to verify acceptance of pipeline for varying DAFs (~1.1 to 1.5 factors)

Notes:

- For smaller vessels, stinger angles, articulations, installation aids such as buoyancy can be used to increase the feasibility of installation or expand the weather windows.

Umbilicals or power cables:

- At the vessel interface (e.g. chutes etc.)
  - Tension: The expected tension DAF is of the order of 1.1 to 1.2 times.
  - The bending moment DAF is typically 1.1 to 1.2 times. The installation angle can be altered to reduce the bending moment.
- At the seabed interface (e.g. touchdown zone etc.)
  - The expected tension DAF and/or compression may play a role.
  - The bending moment DAF is typically 1.2 to 1.4 times.

Notes:

- 1st end deployment may need weight to increase installation feasibility.
- 2nd end deployment may need buoyancy to increase installation feasibility and stab-into cobra head connectors etc.
- Smaller umbilicals or power cables: 0.5 Te to 1 Te of compression is typical. Final value from vendor. For critical seastates, compression may be expected. The vendor typically provides acceptable compression during installation to help improve weather windows.
