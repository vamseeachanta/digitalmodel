Hydrotesting with Air vs. Water – Know the Risk

Figure 2 shows a typical pressure manifold used in hydrotesting. While air might seem like a quicker, cleaner option for pressure testing pipelines, it’s not always the safer one.

In my youth, a senior engineer once told me: “Never test with air if you can help it. Air is compressible. Water isn’t.” That advice stuck with me.
Here’s why:
 If a pipeline fails under a water test, the water simply spills out. But with compressed air, a rupture releases stored energy explosively—like a bomb. The risk to life and equipment is far greater.

Still, there are times when air testing makes sense—such as when one end of the line is far higher than the other, and water would cause an unnecessary pressure differential. In these cases, air is sometimes used very carefully, often at lower pressures and with additional precautions.

Other benefits of water hydrotesting:
Easier to control and detect small leaks.
No sudden pressure drop due to temperature changes.
Far less dangerous if something fails.

Always weigh the risks. Just because something is faster doesn’t mean it’s better.
