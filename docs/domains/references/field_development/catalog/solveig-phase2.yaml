notes: >
  Fifth Aker BP project sanctioned in 2022 to reach production. Subsea tieback
  leverages existing Edvard Grieg processing capacity to extend plateau and
  improve unit economics through infrastructure sharing. Three wells target
  both new and existing reservoir segments. 39 MMboe recoverable resources.
  Capital-efficient development with no new host facility required.
