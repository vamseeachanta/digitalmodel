notes: >
  Jack and St. Malo are adjacent deepwater discoveries in Walker Ridge developed
  via a shared SPAR facility — the world's largest SPAR at FID. Water depth of
  ~2,134 m. The SPAR hosts 25 production and injection wells across the two
  fields. First oil December 2014. Subsalt Lower Tertiary Wilcox play — same
  reservoir interval as Cascade/Chinook and Tiber. Benchmark for ultra-deepwater
  SPAR economics in the GoM Lower Tertiary trend.
