notes: >
  Vito is a benchmark for radical GoM deepwater cost reduction. The original
  development concept was redesigned from a 5+ bn USD scheme to 1.7 bn USD
  by simplifying the hull (smaller semi with fewer risers), reducing topsides
  weight by 70%, and renegotiating all major contracts. Shell aimed for a
  breakeven below 35 USD/bbl. The FPS uses a conventional spread mooring
  polyester system in ~1,220 m water depth. First oil late 2022 / early 2023.
  Demonstrates that GoM deepwater breakevens can approach NCS shallow-water
  levels through concept simplification.
