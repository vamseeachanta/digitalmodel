In 1997 a task force was formed to consider proposed changes to the RP based on a growing

high pressure pipelines having a low diameter to wall thickness (D/t) ratio. In fact the second

which typically require these low D/t ratio, see ASME B31.4, 400.1.2(d) and ASME B31.8,

## Variable Glossary

Common symbols appearing in the extracted equations. Interpretations may vary by standard; confirm per source.

- `D`: outside diameter (generic)
- `MAWP`: maximum allowable working pressure
- `P`: pressure
- `Pe`: external pressure
- `RSF`: remaining strength factor
- `fu`: ultimate tensile strength
- `fy`: yield strength
- `t`: wall thickness (generic)
- `tmin`: minimum wall thickness

## Normalized Equation Forms

Normalized notation for quick calculation. Use original per-version equations for authoritative definitions.

- Original: `Pe = Internal pressure in the pipe, in psi (N/mm’)`
  Normalized: `P_e = Internal pressure in the pipe, in psi (N/mm’)`

## Standardized Calculation Workflows

High-level steps per standard bucket. Use the per-version equations above for exact inputs and limits.

### DNV (F101/F201)
1. Define pipe geometry and material properties (D, t, fy, fu).
2. Determine design pressures (internal/external) and safety factors.
3. Compute burst/collapse/propagation checks using DNV equations.
4. Compare to allowable limits and select required wall thickness.

### API 579 / ASME FFS-1
1. Gather measured wall thickness data and corrosion rates.
2. Calculate remaining strength factors (RSF) and minimum required thickness.
3. Evaluate MAWP/allowable stress against criteria.
4. Determine acceptability or required repair/derating.

### API RP 1111
1. Set nominal dimensions and material strengths.
2. Apply API RP 1111 burst/limit-state equations for required thickness.
3. Check against design pressure and safety factors.
4. Select wall thickness meeting all checks.
