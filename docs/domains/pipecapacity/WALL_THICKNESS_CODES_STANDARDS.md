5.3 Determination of Wall Thickness

The determination of the wall thickness of the tubes and
fittings in a heater is an essential feature of inspection.

A wall thickness value obtained by measuring the inside
and outside tube diameters is called an indicated metal thick-

```
various sections of heater fittings to determine accurately the
point of minimum wall thickness. In the case of the rolled-
on type of fitting, the easiest and most commonly used

```
Ultrasonic methods for obtaining tube-wall thickness are
probably the most widely used methods. For most corrosion
```
```
comparing with some geometric standard projected on the
film, the wall thickness can be determined. Radiographic
techniques are particularly useful where the coil has welded

e Collapse design should include the effects of sag bend strain levels during installation as well as
extreme loading, shut down/depressurised and minimum wall thickness cases.
```
```
e SCFs from geometric discontinuities should be quantified, with regard to pre-weld fit up (hi-lo)
limits resulting from out of roundness (UOE pipe), non-uniform wall thickness (seamless pipe) and
tolerances of weld preps.

Wall thickness must account for all potential modes of failure, as follows:

Calculations should allow for reduced wall thickness due to manufacturing tolerances, corrosion and wear.
Corrosion may be neglected for installation and hydrotest conditions.

Further increases in riser wall thickness may be required to comply with extreme storm criteria, as determined by

Wall thickness must account for all potential modes of failure; eg:

Calculations should allow for reduced wall thickness due to manufacturing tolerances, corrosion and wear, although
corrosion may be neglected for installation and hydrotest conditions.

```
Increased wall thickness may be required — perhaps only locally - to comply with dynamic response criteria.

More generally, optimization of wall thickness over the full riser length may help reduce cost and vessel interface
loads. However, such an exercise is likely to be more beneficial for designs governed by collapse, and may yield no

extreme loading, shut down/depressurised and minimum wall thickness cases.

Wall thickness must account for all potential modes of failure, as follows:

Calculations should allow for reduced wall thickness due to manufacturing tolerances, corrosion and wear.
Corrosion may be neglected for installation and hydrotest conditions.

Further increases in riser wall thickness may be required to comply with extreme storm criteria, as determined by
