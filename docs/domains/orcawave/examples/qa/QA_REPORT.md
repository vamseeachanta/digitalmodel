## Status

> **Pending execution**: `.owr` result files are not yet generated (WRK-318 run scripts
> must be executed first). This report will be updated when results are available.

Run the QA suite with:

| L01 | `heave_rao_quasi_static` | Heave RAO → 1.0 at long period |
| L02 | Same as L01 | + drag linearisation convergence implied |
| L03 | Same as L02 | + `coupling_symmetry_A12_A21` |
| L04 | RAOs, damping, added mass | Sectional bodies |

| L06 | RAOs, added mass | + `qtf_data_present` |

## Physics Rationale

- **Heave RAO → 1.0 at long periods**: At quasi-static (long period) limit, a freely
  floating body moves in phase with the wave elevation, giving a heave RAO of 1.0.
  Deviations indicate mooring stiffness or mesh problems.

- **Positive diagonal damping**: Radiation damping diagonal must be non-negative by
  energy conservation. Negative values indicate numerical errors.

- **Coupling symmetry**: For multi-body systems, the cross-body added mass A₁₂
  should equal the transpose A₂₁ᵀ (reciprocity). Large violations indicate mesh
  issues or body positioning errors.

- **QTF symmetry**: The full QTF matrix Q(ω₁, ω₂) should satisfy
  Q(ω₁, ω₂) = Q*(ω₂, ω₁) for the difference-frequency case.
