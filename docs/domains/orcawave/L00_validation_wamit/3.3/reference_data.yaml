# WAMIT Reference Data for Case 3.3 - Multi-body Cylinder + Ellipsoid - Full QTFs
# Source: OrcaWave Validation Report, Project 1429, revision 01
# Data type: qtf_full_multibody
#
# Status: TEMPLATE - numeric values require population via:
#   1. OrcaWave .owd execution (preferred, exact values)
#   2. Manual digitization from Figure 36 (p49), Figure 37 (p50)
#
# To populate with OrcaWave:
#   Run the .owd file in the 'OrcaWave v11.0 files/' subdirectory,
#   extract results, and fill in the empty arrays below.
#   Then set status: 'populated' and populated_by: 'owd_execution'

title: Multi-body Cylinder + Ellipsoid - Full QTFs
vessel_names:
- Cylinder
- Spheroid
solver: WAMIT v6.4S
source: OrcaWave Validation Report, Orcina Project 1429, revision 01
source_figures:
- Figure 36 (p49)
- Figure 37 (p50)
data_type: qtf_full_multibody
water_depth: infinite
body_descriptions:
  Cylinder: Vertical cylinder, FIXED. Same geometry as Case 2.6 but with finer vertical mesh discretization.
    Mesh includes interior free surface for IRR removal.
  Spheroid: Ellipsoid, FREELY FLOATING. Position offset from cylinder. Mesh includes interior free surface
    for IRR removal. Two planes of symmetry per body.
mesh:
  cylinder_panels_per_quadrant: 420
  ellipsoid_panels_per_quadrant: 220
  symmetry: yz (global)
  notes: Finer vertical discretization than Case 2.6 meshes. Model rotated 90 deg from WAMIT TEST103a
    to use YZ symmetry.

notes: Full QTFs = PI quadratic load + indirect potential load. Excellent agreement between OrcaWave and
  WAMIT for both bodies. Bidirectional QTFs validated (beta1=0, beta2=30). 12 total DOFs (6 per body).
