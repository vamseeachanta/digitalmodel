# Data type: mean_drift_convergence
#
# Status: TEMPLATE - numeric values require population via:
#   1. OrcaWave .owd execution (preferred, exact values)
#   2. Manual digitization from Figure 26 (p35), Figure 27 (p36)
#
# To populate with OrcaWave:
#   Run the .owd file in the 'OrcaWave v11.0 files/' subdirectory,
#   extract results, and fill in the empty arrays below.
#   Then set status: 'populated' and populated_by: 'owd_execution'

notes: 'For non-wall-sided body (z0=0.2), WAMIT CS loads do not converge to PI limit. For wall-sided body
  (z0=0), both programs pass convergence test. Orcina hypothesis: WAMIT CS results incorrect for non-wall-sided
  bodies. See Section 2.8.'
