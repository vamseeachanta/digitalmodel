## 3. Code Coverage Audit

Source file: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/digitalmodel/src/digitalmodel/infrastructure/common/cathodic_protection.py`

### 3.1 Router

| Method | Standard Claimed | Actual Standard Content |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `router()` | dispatch only | dispatches on `cfg["inputs"]["calculation_type"]`: `"ABS_gn_ships_2018"` → `ABS_gn_ships_2018()`; `"DNV_RP_F103_2010"` → `DNV_RP_F103_2010()` |

### 3.2 DNV F103 Route — Private Methods

| Method | Docstring / Comment | Formula Implemented | Correct Standard? | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| `_dnv_pipeline_geometry` | "DNV RP-F103 2016 / Saipem approach" | A_ext = π·D·L; A_s = π/4·((D)²−(d)²); RL = ρ_Me / A_s | F103-2016 (Eq.8 variant) | Longitudinal resistance RL = ρ_Me/A_s is 2016 feature; 2010 uses Eq.8 R_Me = L·ρ_Me/(π·d·(D−d)) |
| `_dnv_coating_breakdown` | "DNV RP-F103 2016 / Saipem approach" | compound exponential; includes `wet_storage_years` | F103-2016 hybrid | Wet storage period is 2016 feature; 2010 uses linear f_cm = a + 0.5·b·t_f (Annex 1) — formula is non-standard |
| `_dnv_current_densities` | references "Table 4-1" and "Table 4-2" | coating-quality lookup (excellent/good/average/poor) + Arrhenius temperature correction + soil resistivity factor | INCORRECT — table numbers do not exist in F103-2010 or F103-2016 | F103-2010 uses Table 5-1 (burial + internal fluid temp). Coating quality categories are non-standard. Temperature Arrhenius correction not in any F103 edition. Table references are fabricated. |
| `_dnv_current_demand` | — | I = A · i_design · CBF · design_margin | F103-2010 Eq.1/Eq.3 (correct form) | Design margin factor not in F103-2010 (is in EMX GP k=1.1) |
| `_dnv_anode_requirements` | — | M = I_total · t_f · 8760 / (u · ε) | F103-2010 Eq.5 (correct) | Capacity ε and utilization u must match standard values |
| `_dnv_anode_spacing` | — | uniform distribution via np.linspace; validates against min/max spacing | F103-2010 Sec.5.10 (default ≤300 m) | Spacing validation present; max spacing constant should be checked against configured value |
| `_dnv_attenuation` | "DNV RP-F103 2016 / Saipem approach" | simplified 2010: La = sqrt(D·t·ρ_coating / (4·ρ_steel·ln(D/d))); enhanced 2016: α = sqrt(π·D·RL·CBFf·P/8) where P = (Ecorr−Ea)/i_mean | Both F103-2010 Sec.5.11 and F103-2016 enhanced formula | Two paths present; 2016 path uses polarization resistance P — correct conceptually for 2016 |

### 3.3 ABS Ships Route — Private Methods

| Method | Standard Section | Formula Implemented | Correct Standard? | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| `_abs_breakdown_factors` | ABS GN Ships Dec 2017 Table 4 | compound exponential CBF | ABS GN Ships Dec 2017 | ABS uses compound exponential (correct vs ABS); different from DNV linear model |
| `_abs_current_densities` | ABS GN Ships Dec 2017 Table 3/5 | coated_current × fcm / fcf; disbonding model | ABS GN Ships Dec 2017 | Disbonding model consistent with ABS approach |

### 3.4 Standalone / Utility Methods

| Method | Standard Referenced | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|----|
| `get_anode_current_capacity` | ABS-referenced in docstring | Zn=780, Al=2000−27·(T−20); Al formula is temperature-dependent linear — consistent with ABS GN Ships |
| `get_seawater_resistivity` | ABS-referenced | water type map lookup |
| `calculate_anode_resistance` | ABS-referenced | slender/flush formulas in cm units |
| `get_design_current_density` | ABS-referenced | — |
| `get_required_current_density` | ABS-referenced | — |
| `get_anodes_required` | ABS-referenced | ABS formula |
| `anode_initial_check` | ABS-referenced | ABS check |
| `anode_final_check` | ABS-referenced | ABS check |

Note: These standalone methods are NOT called from `router()`. They appear to be legacy helper functions predating the router pattern.

## 4. Gap Analysis

### 4.1 Critical Defects (must fix before production use)

| # | Location | Defect | Correct Reference | Severity | Status |
|---|----------|--------|------------------|----------|--------|
| G-1 | `_dnv_current_densities` | Table references "Table 4-1" and "Table 4-2" do not exist in F103-2010 or F103-2016. F103-2010 uses Table 5-1. The table numbers appear fabricated. | F103-2010 Table 5-1 | Critical | **Fixed** — replaced with `_F103_2010_TABLE_5_1` dict lookup; table reference in docstring updated. |
| G-2 | `_dnv_current_densities` | Coating quality categories (excellent/good/average/poor) are not in any edition of F103. Current densities in F103-2010 Table 5-1 depend on burial condition (non-buried vs buried) and internal fluid temperature, not coating quality. | F103-2010 Table 5-1 | Critical | **Fixed** — method now accepts `burial_condition` + `internal_fluid_temperature_C`; coating-quality lookup removed. |
| G-3 | `_dnv_current_densities` | Arrhenius temperature correction applied to current densities. F103-2010 provides discrete values by fluid temperature range; no Arrhenius correction factor is specified. | F103-2010 Table 5-1 | Critical | **Fixed** — Arrhenius correction and soil-resistivity factor both removed. |
| G-4 | `_dnv_coating_breakdown` | Compound exponential formula used instead of the linear formula specified in F103-2010 Annex 1: f_cm = a + 0.5·b·t_f. The non-standard formula will produce incorrect mean coating breakdown factors relative to the qualified standard. | F103-2010 Annex 1 Eq.A.1–A.4 | Critical | **Fixed** — replaced with F103-2010 Annex 1 linear formula; `_F103_2010_TABLE_A1` class-level constant added with Table A.1 values from PDF. |
| G-5 | `_dnv_pipeline_geometry` | RL = ρ_Me / A_s formula is a 2016 feature (DNVGL-RP-F103-2016). F103-2010 uses R_Me = L·ρ_Me / (π·d·(D−d)) (Eq.11). The class is named `DNV_RP_F103_2010` but implements a 2016 formula. | F103-2010 Eq.11 vs F103-2016 | Major | **Fixed** — longitudinal resistance per unit length now uses F103-2010 Eq.11: `rho_Me / (pi * d * (D - d))`; default resistivity updated to 0.2e-6 ohm.m (CMn steel, Sec.5.6.10). |

### 4.2 Version Mismatch (misleading class naming)

| # | Location | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| V-1 | Class `DNV_RP_F103_2010` | The class name claims 2010 but three private methods (`_dnv_pipeline_geometry`, `_dnv_coating_breakdown`, `_dnv_attenuation`) explicitly document "DNV RP-F103 2016 / Saipem approach". The implementation is a hybrid of 2010 and 2016, not a clean 2010 implementation. |
| V-2 | `_dnv_attenuation` | The enhanced attenuation path using polarization resistance P = (Ecorr−Ea)/i_mean is from F103-2016. Selecting the correct code path depends on configuration; misapplication will produce incorrect results. |
| V-3 | `_dnv_current_demand` | Design margin factor (k) is from EMX GP 56-01-04U (k=1.1) and not present in F103-2010. Applying it when calculating to F103-2010 adds an undocumented safety factor. |

### 4.3 Missing Standard Implementations

| Standard | Scope | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| DNV-RP-B401 (any edition) | Offshore structures SACP | Not implemented — no `_b401_*` methods exist |
| ABS GN Offshore Dec 2018 | FPSOs, TLPs, DDCVs, fixed jackets | Not implemented |
| ISO 15589-2:2004 | Offshore pipeline CP | Not implemented |

## 5. Go / No-Go Assessment for Phase 2 (Implementation)

**Recommendation: CONDITIONAL GO — DNV F103 route requires critical fixes before Phase 2 expansion**

### Go conditions (ABS Ships route)
- The `ABS_gn_ships_2018` route and all `_abs_*` private methods correctly implement ABS GN Ships Dec 2017 formulas.
- Anode resistance geometry cases (slender_offset, short_flush, long_flush) match ABS Sec.3.3.
- Mass formula, coating breakdown model, and current density model are consistent with ABS GN Ships Dec 2017.
- Status: **GO for ABS Ships route** — suitable for production after test coverage verification.

### No-Go conditions (DNV F103 route — must fix first)
Three critical defects (G-1, G-2, G-3) make the `_dnv_current_densities` method produce results that cannot be traced to any recognized standard. The fabricated table references and non-standard coating-quality lookup mean calculation outputs are unauditable. G-4 (wrong coating breakdown formula) compounds this — mean CBF will be wrong for any certified pipe coating.

Before Phase 2 work on the DNV route:
1. Decide target standard version: F103-2010 (clean) or F103-2016 (clean). The current hybrid is neither.
2. Replace `_dnv_current_densities` with Table 5-1 lookup (2010) or Table 4-1/4-2 lookup (2016, once PDF is obtained).
3. Replace `_dnv_coating_breakdown` compound exponential with F103-2010 linear model, or with verified 2016 formula.
4. Rename class or add version flag to make actual standard version explicit.
5. Obtain DNVGL-RP-F103 July 2016 PDF to verify 2016-specific formulas before implementing a clean 2016 path.

### B401 offshore structures route
- No B401 implementation exists. Phase 2 can add it as a new route.
- B401-2021 is the current edition and should be the implementation target.
- B401-2021 PDFs are locally available (pages 1–30 audited); full formula set confirmed readable.

## 6. Standards Still Needed

| Standard | Priority | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| DNVGL-RP-F103 July 2016 | High | Needed to verify 2016-specific formulas currently hybrid-implemented in `_dnv_coating_breakdown`, `_dnv_pipeline_geometry`, `_dnv_attenuation`. Without it, the 2016 code path cannot be audited. |
| DNVGL-RP-B401 June 2017 | Medium | Needed to implement B401 route; 2021 is available but 2017 is required if project specifications reference it (ExxonMobil GP 56-01-08U is 2017-based). |
| NACE SP0169 | Medium | Onshore pipeline CP; commonly cross-referenced; needed if scope expands to onshore |
| NACE SP0176 | Low | Offshore platform CP; provides NACE perspective vs DNV/ABS |
| NORSOK M-501 | Low | Surface preparation and coating; referenced in B401-2005 coating categories |
| ISO 15589-2:2012 (2nd ed.) | Low | Updated edition of the standard that F103-2010 was based on; relevant if ISO compliance is required |
