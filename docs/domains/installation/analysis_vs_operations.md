Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Reality in Marine Operations 🌊

Last week, our Bernt Sørby took the stage at "Marine Operations in Practice" in Bergen, presenting on a topic that lies at the heart of our work:
“Marine Operations in Theory vs. Marine Operations in Practice – How to Combine the Best of Two Worlds.”

In his presentation, Bernt explored the often overlooked discrepancies between analytical models and operational realities – and how we can close that gap.

🌊Theory differs from practice due to conservatism & uncertainty
🌊Conservatism - DNV RP assumes blind and unlucky crane operator
🌊Sources of uncertainty stem from simplified physics
🌊More accurate physics removes uncertainty plus helps understand the behaviour of the lift
🌊Remove uncertainty during execution by re-analysing with actual weather
🌊Potential for removing alpha factor


It sparked important conversations about aligning theory with practice to improve safety, efficiency, and confidence in marine operations.
Kudos to Bernt for representing Entail and helping move the industry forward!
