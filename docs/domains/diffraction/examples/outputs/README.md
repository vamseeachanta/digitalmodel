# Example Outputs Directory

**ABOUTME**: Generated output files from diffraction conversion examples. These files are not committed to version control.

---

## Purpose

This directory contains output files generated by running the example scripts in the parent directory.

## Files Generated

When you run `complete_conversion_example.py`, the following files are created here:

1. **Example_FPSO_vessel_type.yml** - OrcaFlex vessel type definition
2. **Example_FPSO_raos.csv** - RAO data in wide format
3. **Example_FPSO_added_mass.csv** - Added mass matrices in long format
4. **Example_FPSO_damping.csv** - Damping matrices in long format
5. **Example_FPSO_hydrodynamics.xlsx** - Complete Excel workbook with 5 sheets
6. **Example_FPSO_summary.txt** - Text summary report
7. **validation_report.json** - Detailed validation results

## Git Ignore

All generated files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. To generate the files:

```bash
cd D:/workspace-hub/digitalmodel
uv run python docs/domains/diffraction/examples/complete_conversion_example.py
```

## File Sizes

Typical file sizes for the example FPSO (17 frequencies, 12 headings):
- Vessel type YAML: ~330 bytes
- RAO CSV: ~26 KB
- Added mass CSV: ~34 KB
- Damping CSV: ~39 KB
- Excel workbook: ~26 KB
- Summary text: ~900 bytes
- Validation JSON: ~2 KB

**Total**: ~128 KB for complete output set

**Note**: These files are regenerated each time the example script runs. They are not committed to the repository to keep it clean and because they can be easily recreated.
