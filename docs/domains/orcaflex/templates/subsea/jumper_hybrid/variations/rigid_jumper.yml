# Variation: Rigid Steel Pipe Jumper
# IMPORTANT: When overriding Lines, must include ALL properties
#
# Rigid steel jumper using 10-inch pipe-in-pipe bundle
# Higher stiffness requires longer length for same span to achieve sag

Lines:
  # Rigid jumper - 10-inch steel bundle
  # Requires more length for M-shape due to higher stiffness
  # 65m length for 50m span
