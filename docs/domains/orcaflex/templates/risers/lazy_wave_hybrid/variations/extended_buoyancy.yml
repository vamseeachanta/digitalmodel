# Variation: Extended Buoyancy Section
# IMPORTANT: When overriding Lines, must include ALL properties
# because OrcaFlex replaces the entire object definition
#
# This variation uses a longer buoyancy section for greater
# decoupling between vessel motion and touchdown point

Lines:
  # Lazy Wave Riser with extended buoyancy
  # Buoyancy section increased from 200m to 350m
