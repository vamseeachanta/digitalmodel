# Case: Large Bore 12-inch Flexible Riser
# Standalone model - cannot use BaseFile + IncludeFile due to LineType name change
#
# LIMITATION: OrcaFlex BaseFile/IncludeFile cannot change LineType names because
# the Line object in the base model references the original LineType name.
# Therefore, this case is a complete standalone model.
#
# Configuration: 12-inch flexible riser in lazy wave configuration
# Water depth: 1000m
# Riser: 12-inch flexible pipe with buoyancy section
