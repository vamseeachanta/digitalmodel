# Flexible Riser Base Model - Hybrid Template
# Uses library components via IncludeFile for reusable line types
#
# Configuration: Flexible riser in lazy wave configuration from FPSO to seabed
# Water depth: 1000m (deep water)
# Riser: 8-inch flexible pipe with buoyancy section
#
# Flexible riser characteristics:
#   - Unbonded or bonded multi-layer construction
#   - Lower bending stiffness than steel risers
#   - Suitable for dynamic applications
#   - Common configurations: lazy wave, steep S, free-hanging
#
# Lazy wave configuration:
#   - Upper catenary: Hangoff to sag bend
#   - Buoyancy section: Creates wave shape (sag bend to hog bend)
#   - Lower catenary: Hog bend to touchdown
#
# Usage:
#   1. Use directly for basic analysis
#   2. Use with BaseFile + variation for parametric studies
