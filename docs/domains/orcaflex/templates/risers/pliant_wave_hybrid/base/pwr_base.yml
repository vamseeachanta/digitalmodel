# Pliant Wave Riser Base Model - Hybrid Template
# Uses library components via IncludeFile for reusable line types
#
# Configuration: Pliant wave riser from FPSO to seabed
# Water depth: 800m
# Riser: 10-inch X65 steel with distributed buoyancy
#
# Pliant wave configuration:
#   - Upper section: Hangoff to sag bend
#   - Buoyancy section: Creates wave shape
#   - Lower section: Hog bend to touchdown
#
# Different from Lazy Wave: More pronounced wave, touchdown on seabed
#
# Usage:
#   1. Use directly for basic analysis
#   2. Use with BaseFile + variation for parametric studies
