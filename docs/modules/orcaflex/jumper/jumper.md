One of the most thrilling moments for an Installation Analysis Engineer is when the actual lift perfectly aligns with his calculations and analysis. This is especially rewarding when the lifting configuration results from multiple simulations done to optimize several factors like load spreading, stress distribution, and minimum tilt while meeting various constraints like vessel free space and crane capacity. 

I had one of those moments last week when OceanLift Subsea successfully loaded out the first Tullowâ€™s massive 3D jumper for upcoming installation in around 1100 meters of water depth.

It is expected that the deployment and lowering of the jumper will also follow the performed dynamic analysis.
