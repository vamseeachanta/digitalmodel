Spool or Rigid Jumper is a prefabricated pipe to transport production fluid between two subsea components, those subsea components could be Tree, Manifold, PLET, PLEM or ILS/ILT. There are typically made up of components such as: pipes, bends, flanges, fittings, Connector, Buoyancy, Lifting Clamps, Anodes and VIV Devices.

During design phase, if Both End Structure (Manifold/PLET/ILT/Wellhead) has not been installed, the designer needs to consider the Installation tolerances for both Structure, but If One of the End Structure has been installed, We can refer the other structure to the existing structure, so we are only having one Installation tolerances. Installation, Measurement & Fabrication Tolerances will make Design of Rigid Spool and Jumper is very complicated with so many possibilities (Length X-Y-Z, Angular Rot X-X, Y-Y, Z-Z, Embedment, Expansion, etc). It looks like simple analyses but it comes with many possibilities and at the end, it is about probabilities analyses, because It might not be wise to choose the worst of worst.

During Installation, We need to cover
1. In Air Lift Analyses
2. Splazh Zone Lift Analyses
3. Lowering Analyses
4. Landing Analyses

It looks like simple Structural Analyses, but it could be quite complicated when we look from the dynamic perspective.


One of the most thrilling moments for an Installation Analysis Engineer is when the actual lift perfectly aligns with his calculations and analysis. This is especially rewarding when the lifting configuration results from multiple simulations done to optimize several factors like load spreading, stress distribution, and minimum tilt while meeting various constraints like vessel free space and crane capacity. 

I had one of those moments last week when OceanLift Subsea successfully loaded out the first Tullowâ€™s massive 3D jumper for upcoming installation in around 1100 meters of water depth.

It is expected that the deployment and lowering of the jumper will also follow the performed dynamic analysis.
