# Umbilical Base Model - Hybrid Template
# Uses library components via IncludeFile for reusable line types
#
# Configuration: Dynamic umbilical from platform to subsea
# Water depth: 800m
# Umbilical: Dynamic flexible umbilical
#
# Umbilical connects platform to subsea distribution unit (SDU)
# Used for control, power, hydraulics, and chemical injection
#
# Usage:
#   1. Use directly for basic analysis
#   2. Use with BaseFile + variation for parametric studies
