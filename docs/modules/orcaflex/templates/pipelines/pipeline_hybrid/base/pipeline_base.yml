# Pipeline Base Model - Hybrid Template
# Uses library components via IncludeFile for reusable line types
#
# Configuration: Seabed pipeline (flowline/export line)
# Water depth: 500m
# Pipeline: 16-inch X65 steel
#
# Pipeline lies on seabed from manifold to platform/PLEM
# Both ends anchored (fixed)
#
# Usage:
#   1. Use directly for basic analysis
#   2. Use with BaseFile + variation for parametric studies
