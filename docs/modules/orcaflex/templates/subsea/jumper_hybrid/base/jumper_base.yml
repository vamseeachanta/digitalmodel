# Subsea Jumper/Flying Lead Base Model - Hybrid Template
# Uses library components via IncludeFile for reusable line types
#
# Configuration: Flexible jumper between two subsea structures
# Water depth: 500m
# Jumper type: 6-inch flexible pipe
# Configuration: M-shape (sag in middle)
#
# Connects manifold to PLET/wellhead (both anchored)
# Horizontal span: ~50m, total length: ~60m
#
# Usage:
#   1. Use directly for basic analysis
#   2. Use with BaseFile + variation for parametric studies
