# Variation: Large Bore 12-inch Flexible Riser
# IMPORTANT: This variation changes LineTypes which requires special handling
#
# NOTE: Due to OrcaFlex limitation, LineType name changes cannot be applied
# via BaseFile + IncludeFile because Line references the original LineType name.
# Use cases/case_large_bore.yml (standalone model) instead.
#
# This file documents the 12-inch configuration for reference purposes only.
# Do NOT use with BaseFile - it will fail because Line still references Flex_8inch.
#
# Large bore configuration:
# - 12-inch ID flexible pipe (vs 8-inch base)
# - Higher production capacity
# - Increased mass and stiffness properties

LineTypes:
  # 12-inch flexible pipe
  - Name: Flex_12inch
    Category: General
    IncludeFile: ../../../../library/line_types/flex_12inch.yml

  # 12-inch with buoyancy modules
  - Name: Flex_12inch_Buoyancy
    Category: General
    IncludeFile: ../../../../library/line_types/flex_12inch_buoyancy.yml

# NOTE: Lines section cannot be included here because it would need to reference
# Flex_12inch which doesn't exist in base model. Use case_large_bore.yml instead.
