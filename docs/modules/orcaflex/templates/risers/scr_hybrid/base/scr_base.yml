# SCR (Steel Catenary Riser) Base Model - Hybrid Template
# Uses library components via IncludeFile for reusable line types
#
# Configuration: Single catenary riser from FPSO to seabed
# Water depth: 1200m (deep water)
# Riser: 10-inch X65 steel (from library)
#
# Usage:
#   1. Use directly for basic analysis
#   2. Use with BaseFile + variation for parametric studies
