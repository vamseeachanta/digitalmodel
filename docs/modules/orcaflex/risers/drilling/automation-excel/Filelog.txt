again run all simulations files and getting below results,

we are changing the boundary condition the results will be updated like this,

Dear Vamsee,

I will do the following changes as discussed below:
Short Term:
1/ Change "Riser length (m)" to "Elevation above Seabed (m)". I will discuss with Harsha/Manoj.
a/ Where is the seabed. Annotate this in all charts
b/ Where is the MSL. Annotate this in all charts
2/ Data is not referencing the right spreadsheet. I will ensure I correct them.
3/ We increased wave height and also time period. This will help us latch on to higher RAOS. I will review the latest results
4/ Link up objectives in sheet from TItle sheet.
5/ I will summarize results again
6/ Ask Manoj for a Stack-up drawing?

Long Term:
1/ Tensioners are not defined at the right location. Usually, the tension ring is located at approximately 5 m above mean sea level (MSL). Discuss with MP and correct it
2/ I have not done tension matching. I will learn from Manoj/Harsha on why we should do tension matching.

by changing the tensioner length 1 in 10 and another one in 15 with same tension 1500KN but results are getting like this
