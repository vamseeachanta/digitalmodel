We don't publicise our future development plans in detail, we just have a very high level overview, available on the website.

I'm not really sure why the distinction between OrcaFlex and OrcaWave is important. From a technical perspective, we chose to put them in separate programs because we felt that gave a better and cleaner user experience.

It also left open the possibility that we might, if sufficient users demanded it, offer OrcaWave as a standalone product. At the moment, as you know, we license OrcaFlex and OrcaWave as one commercial offer, although we tend to think of it, and describe it as OrcaFlex, even though OrcaWave is always supplied alongside OrcaFlex.

It's not inconceivable that there may be some point in the future, as the programs gain functionality, where we decide that OrcaWave and OrcaFlex actually fit well in the same GUI. Right now, with OrcaWave being pure frequency domain diffraction / radiation analysis, we feel that the current design is right. But who knows what the future holds?

Best regards,

David Heffernan

Dear Support Representative,

I am in the process of preparing comprehensive documentation for my company and want to understand your products future roadmap, OrcaFlex vs. OrcaWave. Also, do you have a public backlog (both technically or high level product capabilities) so we know what is in the pipeline such as in GitHub issues?

I hear in conversations (technical and commercial) you do not distinguish between them when it comes to technical questions.

So, commercially and technically, would Orcina combine both the products into one software in the future (or) keep them as separate softwares.

It is a tall question from a small entity. However, it will help organize folder structure documentation etc. i.e. in a separate documents or subsection of document etc.

Thank you,
Vamsee
