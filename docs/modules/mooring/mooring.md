# Mooring

The mooring module is used to define the mooring system of a floating structure. The mooring system is defined by a set of mooring lines, each of which is connected to the structure at one end and to the seabed at the other end. The mooring lines are defined by their geometry, material properties, and connection points. The mooring module is used to define the mooring system of a floating structure.
