    <li><strong>Phase = 0 deg</strong>: Response in-phase with wave (crest at origin = peak response)</li>
    <li><strong>Phase = -90 deg</strong>: Lagging (response peaks after wave crest passes)</li>
    <li><strong>Phase = +90 deg</strong>: Leading (response peaks before wave crest arrives)</li>
    <li><strong>~180 deg jump near resonance</strong>: Transition from quasi-static to resonant regime</li>
    <li><strong>Phase at near-zero amplitude</strong>: Physically meaningless -- ignore phase when amplitude is insignificant</li>
