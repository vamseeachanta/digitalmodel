# Source: OrcaWave Validation Report, Project 1429, revision 01
# Data type: mean_drift
#
# Status: TEMPLATE - numeric values require population via:
#   1. OrcaWave .owd execution (preferred, exact values)
#   2. Manual digitization from Figure 23 (p31), Figure 24 (p32)
#
# To populate with OrcaWave:
#   Run the .owd file in the 'OrcaWave v11.0 files/' subdirectory,
#   extract results, and fill in the empty arrays below.
#   Then set status: 'populated' and populated_by: 'owd_execution'

notes: PI loads show good agreement between OrcaWave and WAMIT. CS loads agree for surge, sway, yaw but
  differ for heave, roll, pitch on non-wall-sided bodies. See Section 2.7.3.
