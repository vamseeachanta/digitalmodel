# Source: OrcaWave Validation Report, Project 1429, revision 01
# Data type: qtf_difference_frequency
#
# Status: TEMPLATE - numeric values require population via:
#   1. OrcaWave .owd execution (preferred, exact values)
#   2. Manual digitization from Figure 33 (p45), Figure 34 (p46)
#
# To populate with OrcaWave:
#   Run the .owd file in the 'OrcaWave v11.0 files/' subdirectory,
#   extract results, and fill in the empty arrays below.
#   Then set status: 'populated' and populated_by: 'owd_execution'

notes: Close PI/CS agreement over most of frequency range. For omega >= 3.5 rad/s, visible CS-PI difference
  in surge quadratic force (finer mesh probably needed). Direct and indirect potential loads also agree
  well. See Section 3.2.
