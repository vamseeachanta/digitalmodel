Automation scripts are usually produced by our clients for their internal use. We have written automation scripts in-house to suit our needs in the same way, but there is not yet any repository where clients can browse through these.

If you have a specific activity that you are automating, please give us as much detail as you can, and we can see if there is a script here that matches. If you have started a script and it is giving you error messages, or the behaviour is not as expected, we can support with that too, so please do share it.

In case you have not seen it, this page is a good start into the documentation of the Python interface to OrcaWave:
