### Summary

Simple vesssel hydrodynamic analysis
- Vessel mesh
  - Internal lid
- Control surface mesh
  - mostly rectangular? 
  - easy to replicate or 
  - generate in Orcawave program (no control on boundaries)
- Damping
  - Without damping, body resonance will occur. Appropraite damping is required
  - Typically underdamped spikes are shown only in displacement RAOs

Multibody hydrodynamic analysis
- Vessel mesh
  - Internal lid
- Control surface mesh

- External damping lid
  - Fluid resonance
  - External lid is required. 
  - Spikes in load RAOs, added mass and damping will usually indicate underdamped fluid resonance.
  - Lid should butt up against the body panel mesh but will not extend through into the hull
