# Module Organization

This repository uses module-based organization for all documentation and engineering references.

## Directory Structure

```

Note: The former `docs/eng/` directory was consolidated into `docs/modules/` (Feb 2026).
All engineering reference materials now live alongside their respective domain modules.

## Cross-Repository Integration

This repository is integrated with the AssetUtilities hub for shared components.

## AI Persistence

The AI context is stored in `.agent-os/context/` and shared with the team through version control.
