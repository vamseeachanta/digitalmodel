For the 12” prod. I noted there is only 0.4 mm of “fat” for the lower riser
                               wall thickness. What’s the reason for this? Now I read 6.7 I think it is
    7.    6.1
```
```
7.    6.1
                               because collapse is governing and you can still put more base tension on
                               before burst governs. Correct?

TITLE:                  Wall Thickness Sizing & Global Configuration
```
```
OBJECTIVE:
To confirm the selected wall thicknesses of all sections of the risers composed of line pipe and
manage the weight of the SLHR.
```
```
•     Control and manage the weight budget
   •     Confirm the selected wall thicknesses for the rigid riser pipe, cross-over joints and straights
         and bends for spoolpieces
```
```
DESCRIPTION: (PSVM)
The preliminary wall thicknesses defined during Pre-sanction for the rigid riser pipe and other
sections of riser composed of line pipe shall be confirmed.
```
```
upthrust capacity of the buoyancy tanks designed during pre-sanction are not exceeded and that
the tension capacity of the selected rigid riser pipe wall thicknesses are not exceeded.
```
```
The SLHR wall thickness sizing report and SLHR Static Analysis & Weight Report shall be updated
and issued for construction.

For the 12” prod. I noted there is only 0.4 mm of “fat” for the lower riser
                               wall thickness. What’s the reason for this? Now I read 6.7 I think it is
    7.    6.1
```

7.    6.1
                               because collapse is governing and you can still put more base tension on
                               before burst governs. Correct?
