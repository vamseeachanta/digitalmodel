notes: >
  Liza Phase 2 (Prosperity FPSO) began production in February 2022, marking
  Guyana's rapid ramp to major oil producer in under a decade from discovery.
  The Prosperity FPSO has a capacity of 220 mboe/d. Low breakeven (~25-35
  USD/bbl) driven by high-quality Cretaceous Campanian sandstone reservoirs
  with excellent flow rates and large areal extent. Benchmark for low-cost
  FPSO development in a frontier basin.
