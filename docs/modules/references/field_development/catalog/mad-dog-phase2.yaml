    Original concept re-scoped from 16 bn to ~9 bn via hull redesign
    and scope reduction (2016). Basis: 50 USD/bbl long-run real, 10% WACC.

notes: >
  Mad Dog Phase 2 (Argos) achieved first oil in January 2023, eight years after
  the original concept was redesigned from a high-cost 16 bn USD scheme to a
  leaner 9 bn USD semi-submersible FPS. The redesign reduced topsides weight by
  20% and cut unit CAPEX substantially. Argos is a polyester-moored semi with 16
  production/injection wells and nameplate capacity of 140 mboe/d. Reference
  case for GoM deepwater cost reduction via concept simplification.
