Text-to-CAD AI is finally here and it's really impressive ??

You can not only generate 3D models but also control their dimensions using just a text prompt.

Former professional CAD engineer:

"This is 100% the future of design. AI has 10-100x'd the productivity of software development but mechanical design is brutally tedious, slow, painful. Zoo can do this for hardware" - Andrew Côté

2025 is going to be a fascinating year for AI.
