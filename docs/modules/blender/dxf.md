## Opening DXF file

To open a DXF file in Blender, you can do the following:
Select File
Select Import
Select the DXF import option
Navigate to the file you want to import
Select the file and click Import
Importing DXF files to Blender 2.8 ? Blender 3D Architect
If the import is successful, the new objects will appear in the outliner. You can scale down the imports by selecting them all, pressing s, inputting 0.0001, and entering.
Blender also has an AutoCAD DXF format import extension that can be found in File ? Import ? AutoCAD DXF. This extension is compatible with Blender 4.2 and newer.
If you're working with a DXF file that has coordinates, you may need to specify an SRID for the file. The scene SRID will be the same as the DXF SRID by default if no SRID custom property is available.
