# Introduction

To maintain todo list for the library

**#TODO**
- The detailed documentation of pyintegrity library. 
    - Need technical steps
    - Practical uses
- For API579:
    - Logging
        - Remove errors (from logs/screen) from plotting and other libraries
    - Refactor input file as follows 
        - Refer to pipe capacity evaluation from pipecapacity (i.e. github and pypi). simplifies master input file further
        - Currently .xlsx is supported for wall thickness grid data. Change to simple .csv  for easy maintenance
    - Results are dumped into single folder
        - Divide them into high-level and detailed results into respective folders
- For fracture mechanics:
    - Logging should be improved. Too much noise on screen from possibly multiple threads.
    - More useful methodologies
