Solving Catenary Equations in Python
The catenary problem you've described - solving for a catenary curve given its length, two endpoints, and end angles - is a common challenge in engineering fields like cable design, suspension bridges, and overhead power lines.

Python Libraries for Catenary Solutions
Here are the most widely used Python libraries for solving catenary equations, arranged in descending order of usage:

SciPy - The scientific computing ecosystem with optimization tools that can solve the catenary equation

Particularly the scipy.optimize module for numerical solution of the boundary value problem
Most widely used general-purpose scientific library with catenary applications
CableEquations - Specialized library for cable and catenary calculations

Provides direct functions for solving catenary problems with various boundary conditions
Handles elastic and inelastic catenary models
PySlaCat - Python Slack Catenary library

Focused specifically on slack cable and catenary analysis
Includes visualization tools for catenary curves
CatenaryPy - Pure Python implementation for catenary solutions

Easy to use with good documentation
Specifically designed for the catenary boundary value problem
FEniCS - Finite element analysis that can solve the differential equations for catenaries

More general purpose but powerful for complex catenary setups
OpenSeesPy - Python interface to OpenSees

Includes cable and catenary elements for structural analysis
Popular in civil engineering applications
NURBS-Python (geomdl) - For geometric modeling including catenary curves

Used when parametric representation of the catenary is needed
Basic Approach to Solving Catenary Problems
The catenary equation in its standard form is:

Code
y = a * cosh(x/a) + C
Where a is the parameter that controls the "tightness" of the catenary, and C is a vertical offset.

For your specific constraints (fixed length, two endpoints, and end slopes), this becomes a boundary value problem that typically requires numerical methods. Here's a simple example using SciPy:


catenary_solver.py
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.integrate import quad

def catenary_curve(x, a, x0, y0):
    """Catenary curve equation: y = a * cosh((x - x0)/a) + y0"""
More Advanced Example Using CableEquations Library
For a specialized solution, you might use the CableEquations library:


catenary_with_cableequations.py
import numpy as np
from cableequations import Catenary

# Define the problem parameters
x1, y1 = 0, 10       # First endpoint
x2, y2 = 30, 10      # Second endpoint
Other Resources
If you're working with overhead conductors or similar applications, many engineering-specific libraries include catenary modeling capabilities:

PyPowerLib - For power line design including catenary sag calculations
