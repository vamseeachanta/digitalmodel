# Introduction

To help perform tasks of installations

# Summary

- Implement any basic hand calculations
- 


## Go-by Guidance

- Use the following as a guideline for reviewing installation results
    - DAF at the hoook (eg 1.8) is typically less than DAF in the slings (eg: 2.5)
- Slings criteria can be based on the rigging nuances such as softeye vs. hard eye, etc. Shackles used etc.

## Design

Static design based on structure orientation and sling lengths can be implemented.

## Analysis

QA of model:
- Structure
    - Wet weight
    - Dry weight
    - Center of gravity    
- Tension on slings vs. total weight of structure


### Splash zone lowering

### Landing analysis

### Resonance analysis
