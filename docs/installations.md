# Introduction

To help perform tasks of installations

# Summary

- Implement any basic hand calculations
- 


## Design

Static design based on structure orientation and sling lengths can be implemented.

## Analysis

QA of model:
- Structure
    - Wet weight
    - Dry weight
    - Center of gravity    
- Tension on slings vs. total weight of structure


### Splash zone lowering

### Landing analysis

### Resonance analysis
