1/5 Water is one of the most important factors in any ship visualization. Whether you‚Äôre depicting a majestic cargo vessel crossing a serene ocean or a sleek yacht cutting through turbulent seas, the water must look realistic to complete the scene. There are several elements that contribute to achieving a lifelike water effect:

‚úÖ Wave Patterns and Reflection
‚úÖ Transparency and Depth
‚úÖ Lighting and Color



2/5 A ship visualization becomes truly stunning when the attention to detail is taken to the next level. While the primary focus is usually on the ship itself, incorporating more intricate elements can enhance the visual appeal and realism:

‚úÖ Textures and Materials
‚úÖ Functional Elements
‚úÖ Ship Interior
‚úÖ Lighting and Shadows

The finer details you add to your ship visualization will make the image come to life, allowing viewers to focus on and appreciate the nuances that make your work stand out.


‚≠ê 3/5 What does it take to make a stunning 3D ship visualization? Settle in an Adequate Background!

The background in a ship visualization serves as the environment in which the vessel resides. It‚Äôs not just about choosing a random ocean; it‚Äôs about selecting a backdrop that complements the ship and enhances its features:

‚úÖ Realistic Environments
‚úÖ Time of Day
‚úÖ Scale and Depth
‚úÖ Weather Conditions

A well-chosen background creates the proper atmosphere and ensures that the ship doesn‚Äôt just look like it‚Äôs floating in a void‚Äîit becomes a part of a world that makes sense to the viewer.


Question: How do you add realistic looking wake pattern and spray from the vessel? Any tips? üôÉ

Answer: that's a combo of different nodes, masks, geometry simulation, and post-production magic. :)


Question: tried to visualize the free surface using data from a cfd simulation but I now think that it hurts more than it helps‚Ä¶ What do you think? Have you ever used cfd data before?

Answer: Actually, we didn't. Usually, for the purpose of 3D visualization, our tricks to create water effects based on photo references are enough. But I wonder if there is a possibility to import a cfd simulation into Houdini and make some magic there. :)

We had the pleasure to create the hashtag#3danimation for NAOS Ship and Boat Design showcasing their innovative Wing Sail Module.

In Sodoma Atelier we provided the complete video creation:
‚ñ∂ 3D modeling of the ships and wings
‚ñ∂ Creating the natural environment: water and sky
‚ñ∂ Creating the storyboard
‚ñ∂ Complete animation production with post-processing
‚ñ∂ Recruiting voiceover artist
‚ñ∂ Adding the music provided by the client
