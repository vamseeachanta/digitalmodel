A generic term help. 
 
When the LNGC is mooring on to the FSTs or to shore, the people have to use a few lines to lock up and stabilize the ship before tightening the other lines iteratively. 
 
What do the marine folks call the lines first used to set the tensions? If not term, what would you call those lines?

A bow or head line is first put ashore. The stern lines then go and breasting lines to bring the ship alongside. The spring lines go next to align the manifold at the required location. The lines are then pulled taught according to the wind and current at that time. The most important thing is to have the manifold aligned.
