# Introduction

Aluminum anodes and Salnity

## Summary

Aluminum anodes are not recommended for use in freshwater. They are best suited for saltwater applications. The reason for this is that aluminum anodes are more active than zinc anodes and are more likely to dissolve in freshwater. This is because the electrical potential of aluminum is higher than that of zinc. This means that aluminum anodes will dissolve more quickly than zinc anodes in freshwater. This is why aluminum anodes are not recommended for use in freshwater.
