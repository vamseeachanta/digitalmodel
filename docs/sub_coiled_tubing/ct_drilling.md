Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) is a drilling method that uses a continuous, flexible steel tube instead of conventional drill pipe. This technique is often used for re-entering existing wells, sidetracking, underbalanced drilling, and accessing difficult reservoirs.

Key Features of CTD:

1. Continuous Tubing: Unlike conventional drill pipe, coiled tubing does not need to be connected and disconnected, reducing tripping time.


2. Underbalanced Drilling (UBD): CTD allows for drilling with lower wellbore pressures, minimizing formation damage.


3. Small Footprint: CTD rigs are compact, making them suitable for offshore, remote, or space-restricted locations.


4. Real-Time Monitoring: Sensors in the coiled tubing provide continuous data for precise control.


Applications of CTD:

Re-entry Drilling: Extending the life of old wells by drilling lateral sections.

Sidetracking: Creating new wellbores from existing wells.

Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD): Controlling wellbore pressure more effectively.

Horizontal and Multilateral Wells: Used where conventional drilling may not be feasible.


CTD is a valuable technique, especially in mature fields where conventional drilling is too expensive or risky.
