Don’t Just Tell Me How Fast You Drilled – tell me how much value you delivered

The true measure of success, whether you are an operator or a supplier to an operator, is how much value you delivered. Speed is only one part of a complex value equation. Understanding the alignment of your contribution to total well life cycle value is extremely important for your and your client’s success in today’s world of well construction.

Value is defined by speed (time to delivery of hydrocarbons / cost driver), cost (both Capex and Opex), Functionality (will the well do what it is intended to do thorough its lifetime), Quality (uptime / maintenance).

Speed – is but one part of the above equation. Glamorous for presenting results but lacks the totality of its true contribution to life cycle value. Its contribution is advancing hydrocarbon production dates and reducing well costs on day rate heavy projects. This leads to well cycle time (release to release) being the true value driver and not simply ROP, BHA time / duration nor section time.

Cost – can be the death knell of all projects. Regardless of your role, you must manage costs. And the overseers must understand that higher day rates for additional valued services often translate to lower well costs.

Functionality – data for geoscientists, in reservoir, micro tortuosity, slugging, …. Simply put, does the well do what it is intended to do through its lifetime. It all starts with data, a well cannot be properly managed if its subsurface environment is not properly (fully) understood. It is less likely to produce as intended if it is not drilled in the reservoir. Unwanted micro tortuosity (not simply dumb old DLS) leads to a series of problems for completion and production that include short life cycle pumps, rod / tubing wear and the like. Porpoising well paths in horizontal wells leads to slugging which can, and does, shut down separators thus production – a topic discussed amongst production personnel but rarely discussed in drilling.

Quality – is high well up time and ease thus low cost of intended maintenance. Just like the vehicle most of us own, no loss of use due to shop repairs while willing to spend time and money on the planned maintenance to achieve this high up time and longer operating duration.

Service companies who only publish how fast their technology drilled are simply talking to themselves and their competitors – their clients really want to know how much value they added, and they rarely present this characteristic. Time to change.
