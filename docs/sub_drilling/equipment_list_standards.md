High Value Work by IADC Contracts Subcommittee - updated standard equipment list for floating units.

This standard equipment list removes a lot of wasted effort from the bidding process for drilling rigs. I was fortunate to be part of the very small IADC Committee who created and issued the first versions for onshore and offshore rigs back in 1993. We were fortunate to be able to model it from the one I had earlier created along with Paul Goodfellow in Shell to streamline our own bidding processes. Adoption by IADC further enhanced industry efficiencies.

Thanks to Stephen Whitfield and Drilling Contractor, Official Magazine of IADC for sharing this information in this video. Click to go to the article and then click to view the newest rig equipment version.
