Red Adair Said, ?Every Blowout Had 5 to 9 Things Go Wrong?!

I recall Red telling me personally back in the early 1980?s that 5 to 9 things had gone wrong on each blowout he and his team attended.

This great man was an exceptional sage in the oil and gas drilling industry. His, and his team?s, accomplishments are well known.

Just imagine if your full rig site personnel complement each realized that any one small act of rectification by them could drop your exposure number under 5 and avoid a blowout. Seriously, stop and think how powerful this would be.

Agreed, many rig site safety programs accomplish a lot for improving personnel safety and often, also, process safety. Although many reviews I have read seem to indicate when accidents occurred in processes, they were the result of a strong emphasis on personnel safety to the detriment of a focus on process safety.

I am just saying that Red was a down to earth, highly successful practitioner and his simple words of wisdom are easily understood by all employees who could then really drive down blowout risk in an empirical manner.

Just saying, ???
