The Path to Integrated Project Management (IPM also known as LSTK) and Contracts with Benefits ? why did it take so long?

IN THE BEGINNING
Oil companies outsourced their drilling departments as drilling contractors in the 1950?s, they retained their services on a footage and turnkey contract basis. US land drilling turnkey steadily declined to the current range of 3% to 4.5%.
Offshore US and Mexico Turnkey blossomed in the 1980?s with 3 contractors; one did more complex jobs at 25% margin, another went for volume work with 8% margin. This activity disappeared by 2000 because of company acquisitions.
Incentive contracts were experimented with globally for years but impeded by some poor results and shifting milestones.

TURNING POINT
A turning point was set in motion in the late 1980?s with an IOC?s ?Drilling in the Nineties? (DITN) strategy for which I crafted the contract structures and strategies. This strategy aimed to outsource more responsibility to contractors with associated incentive payments.  I was involved in some major successes as a drilling contractor in land Turnkey style, reduced well drilling and completion from 13 days to 8 days / rig release to spud in 4 hours location to location, and incentive-based lead contractor offshore, halving well drilling time immediately across 30 wells. Then internal (resistance to change) and external (?dayrate works?) pushback caused a pull back on implementation of DITN.

In the early nineties, I lead a strategy development for Well Construction services with a major service company. Initially approved at C-suite and chairman level, it was dropped in a reaction to business stress of low oil prices.

Early 2000?s, a Latin American operator launched major service companies into delivering very large (300 well) turnkey contracts where aggressive, fast learning curves with cost reductions (one remote DD across 3 rigs) were achieved.

STEPPING UP
Around 2010, IPM contracts grew in the Mid East for both IOC?s and NOC?s. Increased to a level that, in 2016, confirmed market penetration (>10% of international rig activity).

A major service company just reported a Mid-East 320 well IPM project that reduced drilling days from 45 to 13 with over 12,000 Bbls per day production above initial forecasts.

Meanwhile, USA land transformed drilling performance records in unconventional. In one example 75-day wells were cut to 8.5 days over 4 years. A major land drilling contractor has reported that half of their operating rigs now run on drilling contracts with benefits (not simply time incentives).

Drilling Systems Automation adoption is transforming well quality and profitability for IPM / LSTK suppliers.

GET ON BOARD
Times have changed dramatically with outcome-based contracts becoming part of the drilling business landscape. 30 years is a long time for this transition, but it is now in effect.
