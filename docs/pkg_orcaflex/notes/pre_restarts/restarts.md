Usage:

If you wish to disable current and wind from part of the simulation then you could achieve this by using Restarts to split the model into several simulation files, and have current and wind acting for the parts you require.

Detailed Method:

- Parent file should have a time recorded for a time.
- Child file can therefore use that time
- If not time recorded for parent file. then the restart file with start from end of parent file.
