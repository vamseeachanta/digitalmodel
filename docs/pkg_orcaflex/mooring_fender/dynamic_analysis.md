## Introduction

To run dynamic analysis

# From the Pretension Iteration

- Copy the includefile_* files from the pretension iteration to the seperate folder to avoid overwrite of the iterated files.
  - The fender should be set to the correct compression
  - The mooring lines should be set to the correct pretension
- The wind and current should be ramped from zero
- The analysis should be converged using vessel 6 DOF.
  - If absolutely necessary, 3 DOF or none can be used


# Static Analysis

The static mooring tensions are to be achieved.

## Dynamic Analysis

- Define appropraite wind, current and wave and other dynamics as necessary
- Run the dynamic analysis
- Postprocess the results to ensure that the mooring and fender forces are within acceptable limits

# Troubleshooting:

- If a lwl or hwl configuration does not run. Take the nearest line lengths and reiterate again to achieve convergence
