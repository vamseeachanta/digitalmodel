To make a multiple mooring-fender model converge and get the right tensions

## Summary


tests:
 -  tests\modules\orcaflex\orcaflex_analysis\ofx_mooring_analysis.yml

### Detailed Procedure

Technical:
- Define approximate mooring length and locations of the vessel right
- Vessels should be fixed at the predetermined fender compression 
- Mooring should be solved and successful analysis output is required

File Management:
- Save the model in yml file with only BaseFile reference and no other data
 - Note that this .yml file will be iterated and overwritten
