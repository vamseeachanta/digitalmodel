## Introduction

Lateral buckling of pipelines is a phenomenon that occurs when a pipeline is subjected to thermal expansion or contraction. This can cause the pipeline to buckle laterally, which can lead to damage or failure of the pipeline. Lateral buckling can be caused by a number of factors, including temperature changes, pressure changes, and external forces. It is important to design pipelines to prevent lateral buckling and to ensure that they are safe and reliable.

Objective:  Estimate the thermal movement and associated reaction forces for single pipe or Pipe-in-Pipe (PIP) systems.
