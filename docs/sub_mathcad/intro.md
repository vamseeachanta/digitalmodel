## Introduction

MathCAD is used for several calculations across various industries.

### Problem Statement

The object oriented way of programming and heavy UI based calculations are the main features of MathCAD.

Automation and test writing is not straight forward in MathCAD.

Converting these calculations to Python will help in automation and test writing and open up the calculation to a wider audience.

### Objective

- Create a module to convert Matcad calculations into Python code.
- Key questions
  - Is there a MatCAD code parser available to read the calculus equations
  - other?
