## Test Categories

### Working Tests (0 tests)
- Tests that execute successfully without errors
- Primarily configuration and model tests

### Tests with Import Errors (36 tests)
- Tests that fail to import due to missing modules
- Require module path fixes or missing dependencies

## Baseline Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Test Duration**: 6.46 seconds per test
- **Total Execution Time**: 6.46 seconds

## Test Command
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run working tests only (OrcaFlex mooring analysis)
python -m pytest tests/modules/orcaflex/mooring_analysis/ -v

# Quick test run
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## Known Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Many test files have import errors due to module path issues
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Some tests require specific modules that may not be installed
3. **Path Issues**: Tests may need updates to work with current project structure

## Next Steps for Improvement
1. Fix import errors in test files
2. Update module paths to match current structure
3. Add missing test dependencies
4. Increase test coverage
5. Set up proper test fixtures
