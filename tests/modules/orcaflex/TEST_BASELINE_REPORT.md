## Baseline Status

The test suite shows:
- **Total Tests Collected**: 0
- **Tests Passing**: 0 (0%)
- **Tests Failing**: 0
- **Collection Errors**: 0
- **Tests Skipped**: 0

## Conclusion

ğŸ”´ **BASELINE DEGRADED**: Significant test failures detected. Only 0% of tests are passing. Immediate attention required.

## Notes

- Some tests were excluded from this run due to known import issues unrelated to standardization
- The standardization primarily affected folder structure, not test logic
- Test files remain in their original locations (root of test folders)
- Configuration and helper scripts were added without modifying existing test code
