# Complete Prompt History - OrcaFlex Fatigue Analysis

## Initial Request

**User:** 
"using single_analysis module, perform rainflow and fft for files in folder D:\1522\ctr7\orcaflex\rev_a08\output\csv\07c_fatigue and the file pattern is _Strut?.csv. saves outout files in 'rainflow' folder in same directory. Use the filenaming convention by adding _rainflow and _ fft. Only use these columns for analysis: 'time', 'Tension (Vessel End)', 'Tension (Jacket End)'"

## Refinement 1 - FFT Smoothing

**User:** 
"window averaged fft still spiky. use more windows and average to see if it improves else it may be system response and is unavoidable."

**Solution:**
- Reduced window size from 4096 to 1024
- Increased overlap from 50% to 75%
- Result: 137 windows for averaging (smooth spectrum achieved)

## Refinement 2 - Combined Plots

**User:** 
"combine vessel end and jacket end in plots. Also, adjust y axis range to show good plot visibility with peak etc."

**Solution:**
- Combined vessel and jacket data in same subplots
- Implemented percentile-based y-axis scaling (5th to 99.5th percentile)
- Focused on peak visibility

## Refinement 3 - Line Style Differentiation

**User:** 
"for plot with dotted vs. solid or similar so lines are more visible"

**Solution:**
- Vessel End: Solid lines
- Jacket End: Dashed lines (time series), Dotted lines (FFT/Welch)

## Refinement 4 - Color Consistency

**User:** 
"use consistent colors across plots for user convenience"

**Solution:**
- Vessel End: Navy blue (#000080) - consistent across all plots
- Jacket End: Dark red (#8B0000) - consistent across all plots

## Refinement 5 - Data Processing Clarification

**User:** 
"a clarification that the entire time series will be processed instead of first 1000s?"

**Confirmation:**
- Yes, entire time series is processed
- No truncation or sampling
- All data points analyzed

## Refinement 6 - Plot Annotation

**User:** 
"make a note on the plot that analysis uses all data. time series sample shown for user visualization purpose"

**Solution:**
- Added note to time series subplot
- Text: "Note: Analysis uses ALL data points"
- Sub-text: "Time series sample shown for visualization"

## Final Requests

**User:** 
1. "first add this prompt and associated sample data analysis as an test (along with data and output) to the digitalmodel repo, signal_analysis module for future reference."
2. "add raw data and output as well for easy reference for non-python users"
3. "ensure the sample test is working"

**Completed Actions:**
- Created test file: `test_orcaflex_fatigue_analysis.py`
- Added documentation: `FATIGUE_ANALYSIS_REFERENCE.md`
- Created reference folder: `fatigue_analysis_reference/`
- Added raw data samples and outputs
- Verified test execution
