## Detailed File-by-File Breakdown

### Files Requiring Immediate Attention

#### Zero Coverage Files (8 files)
These files represent the highest risk areas with no test coverage:

1. **engine.py** (144 lines) - Core engine functionality
2. **PipeSizing.py** (101 lines) - Critical sizing calculations
3. **catenary_riser_summary.py** (49 lines) - Marine engineering module
4. **time_series.py** (51 lines) - Data analysis component
5. **aqwa.py** (40 lines) - AQWA integration
6. **fea_model.py** (8 lines) - Finite element modeling
7. **aqwa_analysis.py** (6 lines) - Analysis module
8. **__main__.py** (2 lines) - Entry point

#### Low Coverage Files (6 files, 6-20% coverage)
These files have minimal testing and need significant improvement:

- **markdown_docs.py**: 6.0% coverage (15/166 lines covered)
- **analysis.py**: 7.7% coverage (27/229 lines covered)

### Files with Excellent Coverage (11 files, 81-100%)
These represent best practices in the codebase:

- **__init__.py**: 100% coverage (1/1 lines)
- Several utility and configuration modules achieve high coverage

## Technical Configuration Summary

### Coverage Configuration
```ini
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
branch = true
parallel = true
fail_under = 80.0

[tool.coverage.report]
show_missing = true
precision = 2
skip_covered = false
```

### Test Configuration
```ini
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py", "*_test.py"]
addopts = includes coverage, HTML reports, benchmarks
minversion = "7.0"
```

## Conclusion

The DigitalModel project has a solid testing foundation with 675 test methods across 148 files, but faces significant coverage challenges with only 33.42% overall coverage. The test infrastructure is largely functional but requires plugin installations and configuration fixes.

**Priority Focus**: The 8 zero-coverage core modules represent 855 lines of untested code and should be the immediate focus for testing efforts. Addressing these files alone could significantly improve the overall coverage percentage.

**Path Forward**: With proper plugin installation, configuration fixes, and focused testing on core modules, this project can achieve the 80% coverage target within a quarter while maintaining code quality and reliability.
