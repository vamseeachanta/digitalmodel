# world project -2 (SALM CALM Buoy Data Staging)

This folder aggregates the SALM/CALM documentation tracker and technical query log so the missing design inputs for the world project -2 example are explicit. Numeric buoy geometry, mooring, and metocean datasets remain outstanding until the requested design-basis package is released by the operator.

## Files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `metadata.csv` | Project identifiers and current data completeness status. |
| `document_register.csv` | Flattened extract of the SALM OrcaFlex data master (tracking the received PDF calculations, drawings, and reports). |
| `data_requests.csv` | Summary of TQ items raised between 2019â€“2020 describing the missing drawings, design basis, metocean scatter, and component properties. |

## Outstanding Inputs

- Buoy mass properties, inertia matrices, and centre of gravity data (requested in TQ002).
- Operational wave scatter / monitored metocean statistics (TQ003).
- Hydrodynamic coefficients, tanker RAOs, and fatigue assessment standards (TQ004/TQ005).
- Updated hawser and hose replacement properties (TQ005).

The dataset will be expanded with CALM buoy geometry, mooring line templates, and environment conditions once the above documents are supplied.
