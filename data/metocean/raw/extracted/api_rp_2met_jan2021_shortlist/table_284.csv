Clause/Subclause Modifications
A.7.4 Wind Spectra This subclause recommended using the Frøya wind spectra for all storm types.
This subclause now has three subsections:
? (A.7.4.1) Explains which relations are appropriate to which storm type.
Clarifies that squalls are inherently transient phenomena more appropriately
treated in the time domain than by a spectral representation. Adds a figure
showing a comparison of extratropical and tropical storm wind spectra at two
elevations for two representative wind speeds.
? (A.7.4.2) Presents the Frøya equations as appropriate for extratropical
storms. The text and equations in this subsection are unchanged from the
original description except that the figure showing sample wind spectra is
deleted in light of the figure added in A.7.4.1.
? (A.7.4.3) Presents simplified ESDU spectra as appropriate from tropical
cyclones.
Explanation: Comparison of the Frøya-based relations and ESDU wind spectra against measurements in
tropical cyclone events demonstrated that the ESDU relations as presented in A.7.4.3 are a more appropriate
basis for tropical cyclones than the Frøya-based relations (based on wind measurements made offshore
Norway).
Annex H Added regional annex for the US Gulf of Mexico.
Explanation: ISO-19901-1:2015 does not have an annex for the US Gulf of Mexico. This annex has updated
information relative to the First Edition of API 2MET.
Annex I Added regional annex for the US Coast of California.
Explanation: ISO-19901-1:2015 does not have an annex for the US Coast of California. This annex presents
precisely the same information as the First Edition of API 2MET.
Annex J Added regional annex for the Other US Waters.
Explanation: ISO-19901-1:2015 does not have an annex for the Other US Waters (areas outside Gulf of
Mexico and California offshore region). This annex presents precisely the same information as the First
Edition of API 2MET.
