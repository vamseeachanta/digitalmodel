,
Bridge and flotel disengagement,"Bridge and/or flotel disengagement are required once predefined wind/wave criteriaare exceeded."
Installation,"Wind and wave data are usually needed for setting deck and modules, and currentscan be important for running risers and stabbing tension leg platform tendons."
Crane operations,"Wind and waves (or vessel heave) have an impact on safety margins for craneoperations."
Diving operations,Can depend on a number of metocean parameters.
Evacuation,"Meteorological and oceanographic data are vital for decisions regarding time ofevacuation and selection of evacuation means."
Helicopter operations,"Dependent on a number of metocean parameters, principally winds and visibility."
Maintenance,"Maintenance operations, especially outdoor work above the open sea, are oftensubject to restrictions on weather and sea state."
Marine operations,Most marine operations need reliable metocean information.
Production shut-down,"Can depend on a number of metocean parameters, mainly waves and wind."
"Remotely operated vehicleoperations","Candependonanumberofmetoceanparameters,mainlywavesandoceancurrents."
"Search and rescue/manoverboard (SAR/MOB)","Accurate metocean information can be crucial for effective and safe SAR and MOBoperations."
Tanker loading,"Tankerloadingoperationsaresensitivetoseastateandwindconditions,inparticular during docking operations."
Verification studies,"A number of long-term metocean parameters can be required for verification ofoffshorestructures.Verificationstudiescandependonspecialmetoceanparameters or installation of standard instruments in special locations."
