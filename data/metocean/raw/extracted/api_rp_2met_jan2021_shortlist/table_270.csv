NOTE 1 Wind speeds for a given return period are applicable to all water depths throughout the region.,,,,
NOTE 2 Extreme water level is,referenced to,MLLW and,consists of extreme crest elevation plus,"--`,,`,,`,,,,`,```,`,,,````,`,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---"
associated surge and tide.,,,,
NOTE 3 See H.9.2.2.5 for guidance if air gap relative to n-year extreme water level is not positive.,,,,
NOTE 4 See Figure H.20 and Figure H.21 for wave and extreme water level values for water depths,,,,
between 10 m and 120 m.,,,,
NOTE 5 The peak spectral period and period of maximum wave apply to waves in all water depths.,,,,
"When assessing systems with dynamic sensitivity, a ± 2 s variation in wave period should be",,,,
considered.,,,,
"NOTE 6 For depths ? 50 m, the current profile is defined by a three-point shape (see H.9.2.2.6).",,,,
