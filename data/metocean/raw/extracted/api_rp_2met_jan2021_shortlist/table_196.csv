"NOTE 1THassociated with Hmax should be calculated from the wave steepness (S) according to TH= [2?H/gS]0.5max, with g =maxmax9.81 m/s.NOTE 2The current is in-line with the wave, uniform to 70 m, and then uniform from 70 m to the bottom with speed reduced by 1 m/s(never less than 0.1 m/s).NOTE 3The storm tide includes both storm surge and tide, i.e. reference is to MLLW.NOTE 4Where waves are depth-limited, calculate Hmax according to Hmax = 0.78(depth + storm tide).NOTE 5Basis: (1) = based on comprehensive hindcast study verified against measurements, (2) = based on hindcasts and/ormeasurements, (3) = preliminary estimates.",,,,,,,,,
