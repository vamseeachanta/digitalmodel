Application,Comments
Bridge and flotel disengagement,Bridge and/or flotel disengagement are required once predefined wind/wave criteria
,are exceeded.
Installation,"Wind and wave data are usually needed for setting deck and modules, and currents"
,can be important for running risers and stabbing tension leg platform tendons.
Crane operations,Wind and waves (or vessel heave) have an impact on safety margins for crane
,operations.
Diving operations,Can depend on a number of metocean parameters.
Evacuation,Meteorological and oceanographic data are vital for decisions regarding time of
,evacuation and selection of evacuation means.
Helicopter operations,"Dependent on a number of metocean parameters, principally winds and visibility."
Maintenance,"Maintenance operations, especially outdoor work above the open sea, are often"
,subject to restrictions on weather and sea state.
Marine operations,Most marine operations need reliable metocean information.
Production shut-down,"Can depend on a number of metocean parameters, mainly waves and wind."
Remotely operated vehicle,"Can depend on a number of metocean parameters, mainly waves and ocean"
operations,currents.
Search and rescue/man,Accurate metocean information can be crucial for effective and safe SAR and MOB
overboard (SAR/MOB),operations.
Tanker loading,"Tanker loading operations are sensitive to sea state and wind conditions, in"
,particular during docking operations.
Verification studies,A number of long-term metocean parameters can be required for verification of
,offshore structures. Verification studies can depend on special metocean
,parameters or installation of standard instruments in special locations.
