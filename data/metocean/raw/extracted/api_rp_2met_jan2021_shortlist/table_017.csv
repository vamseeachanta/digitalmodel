"NOTE 1     Column 1 gives the basic variable.NOTE 2     Column 2 gives the common range for most variables; limits depend on local climatological conditions.NOTE 3     Column 3 gives the most stringent resolution as determined in WMO-No. 8.NOTE 4     In column 4:I: Instantaneous. In order to exclude the natural small-scale variability and the noise, an average value over a period of 1 min is considered as a minimum and most suitable;averages over periods of up to 10 min are acceptable.A: Averaging. Average values over a fixed time period, as specified by the coding requirements.",,,,,,,,
