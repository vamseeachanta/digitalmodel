NOTE 1Column 1 gives the basic variable.,,,,,,,
NOTE 2Column 2 gives the common range for most variables; limits depend on local climatological conditions.,,,,,,,
NOTE 3Column 3 gives the most stringent resolution as determined in WMO-No. 8.,,,,,,,
NOTE 4In column 4:,,,,,,,
"I: Instantaneous. In order to exclude the natural small-scale variability and the noise, an average value over a period of 1 min is considered as a minimum and most suitable;",,,,,,,
averages over periods of up to 10 min are acceptable.,,,,,,,
"A: Averaging. Average values over a fixed time period, as specified by the coding requirements.",,,,,,,
