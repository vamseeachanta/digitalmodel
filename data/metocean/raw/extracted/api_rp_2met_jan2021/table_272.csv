"When applying the seasonal conditions in this section, the following should be noted."
a) The conditions presented in this section are for water depths of 300 m or greater. They should not be
interpolated or extrapolated to shallow water.
b) The seasonal conditions are for the full population of early and late season tropical cyclones. They
"do not include winter storms, which should be treated as a separate storm population with its own set"
"of derived extremes. Some of the extremes presented in this section, particularly in the post-peak"
"period, may not represent the highest storm-driven n-year wind or wave conditions which could be"
encountered in the periods described. Application of these conditions should include a
comprehensive risk assessment accounting for all storm conditions which could be encountered
"during the period of operation considered, in order to evaluate total risk."
"c) The conditions in this section should be treated as complete load cases, and the wind, waves, and"
current should be treated as omni-directional. Do not use the factors in Figure H.18 to adjust the
"wave heights shown in the seasonal tables; however, the seasonal wave heights should not be"
higher in any given direction than the annual extreme waves adjusted for direction using Figure H.18.
d) Planning for operations in the pre-peak hurricane season should consider the possibility of delayed
"completion due to late arrival of equipment at the beginning of the operation, contingencies during"
"the operation itself, delays due to Loop Current intrusions, and delays due to tropical storm"
"occurrences. Wind, waves, and current corresponding to the latest likely completion date should be"
used in planning.
e) Planning for operations in the post-peak hurricane season should consider the possibility of an early
