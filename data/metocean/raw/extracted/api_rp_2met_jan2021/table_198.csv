"A.7.3 Wind Profile andThis subclause recommended using the Frøya wind profile and time-averagingTime-averaged Windrelations for all storm types. This subclause now has four subsections:Speed?(A.7.3.1) Explains which relations are appropriate to which storm type.?(A.7.3.2) Present the Frøya equations as appropriate for extratropical storms.The text and equations in this subsection are unchanged from the originaldescription.?(A.7.3.3)PresentsimplifiedESDUequationsasappropriatefortropicalcyclones.?(A.7.3.4) Present equations appropriate for squall events that are based on ameasurementprogramthatwasspecificallydesignedtomeasuresquallprofiles and gusts.Explanation: Extensive validation of differing wind relations against wind measurements in tropical cycloneevents demonstrated that the ESDU relations as presented in the annex are a more appropriate basis fortropical cyclones than the Frøya-based relations (based on wind measurements made offshore Norway). Ajoint industry program developed specifically to examine wind profiles and gusts in offshore wind squallsrecommended a new set of relations appropriate to that storm type.",
