,Sea-ice keels can create gouges in the seabed in relatively shallow or intermediate water depths
,(typically less than 25 m water depth).
,Characterization of year-round regional ice cover includes the occurrence and distribution of ice
,"concentrations, thicknesses, floe sizes, and types present during freeze-up, winter, break-up, and"
,open water seasons.
,"Probability of occurrence of specific ice features, such as multi-year hummock fields and ice islands."
,"In areas where ice of glacial origin is to be expected, the annual and seasonal variation in the flux,"
,"concentration, and size of icebergs is relevant."
,"The probability distributions or extreme values of the velocity of pack ice, ice floes, and discrete ice"
