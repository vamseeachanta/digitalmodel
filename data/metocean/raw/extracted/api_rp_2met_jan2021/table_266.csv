NOTE 1 Wind speeds for a given return period are applicable to all water depths throughout the region.,,,,,,
NOTE 2 Extreme water level is referenced to MLLW and consists of extreme crest elevation plus associated surge and tide.,,,,,,
NOTE 3See H.9.2.2.5 for guidance if air gap relative to n-year extreme water level is not positive.,,,,,,
NOTE 4 See Figure H.9 and Figure H.10 for wave and extreme water level values for water depths between 10 m and 120 m.,,,,,,
NOTE 5 The peak spectral period and period of maximum wave apply to waves in all water depths. When assessing systems,,,,,,
"with dynamic sensitivity, a ± 2 s variation in wave period should be considered.",,,,,,
"NOTE 6 For depths ? 50 m, the current profile is defined by a three-point shape (see H.9.2.2.6).",,,,,,
NOTE 7 Reference Figure H.11 for surge and tide in water depths less than 120 m.,,,,,,
