"A.7.4 Wind SpectraThis subclause recommended using the Frøya wind spectra for all storm types.This subclause now has three subsections:?(A.7.4.1)Explainswhichrelationsareappropriatetowhichstormtype.Clarifies that squalls are inherently transient phenomena more appropriatelytreated in the time domain than by a spectral representation. Adds a figureshowing a comparison of extratropical and tropical storm wind spectra at twoelevations for two representative wind speeds.?(A.7.4.2)PresentstheFrøyaequationsasappropriateforextratropicalstorms. The text and equations in this subsection are unchanged from theoriginal description except that the figure showing sample wind spectra isdeleted in light of the figure added in A.7.4.1.?(A.7.4.3)PresentssimplifiedESDUspectraasappropriatefromtropicalcyclones.Explanation: Comparison of the Frøya-based relations and ESDU wind spectra against measurements intropical cyclone events demonstrated that the ESDU relations as presented in A.7.4.3 are a more appropriatebasis for tropical cyclones than the Frøya-based relations (based on wind measurements made offshoreNorway).",
