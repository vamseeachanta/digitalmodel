ARCHIVED: 2025-11-11

This directory contains the OLD MODULE STRUCTURE that has been replaced by the new modular architecture.

REASON FOR ARCHIVAL:
- Old structure used nested directories (not industry standard)
- Environment files used "user specified components" format (opaque, 100 lines)
- Only supported 1-year return period
- Mixed shared and direction-specific files in same directory
- Duplicated structural modules

REPLACED BY:
1. base_files/ (19 structural modules + 108 environment files)
   - Shared structural modules: _01a to _08_groups_discretised.yml
   - Standalone environment files: base_files/env/*.yml
   - JONSWAP wave format (simple, transparent, comparable)
   - All 3 return periods: 1-year, 10-year, 100-year
   - All 12 directions: 0° to 330° in 30° steps

2. analysis_models/ (72 ready-to-run OrcaFlex models)
   - Flat file naming: NSE_CALM_001_<dir>deg_<rp>_<type>.yml
   - Both simple and discretised model types
   - References base_files and env files
   - Industry standard structure (McDermott Woodfibre FST convention)

ARCHIVED CONTENT:
- 12 direction subdirectories (operability_000deg to operability_330deg)
- 36 old environment files (waves, current, wind)
- 20 root-level module files (duplicates + obsolete)
- Total: 56 files

NEW STRUCTURE BENEFITS:
✓ No duplication (single source of truth)
✓ Flat structure (easy navigation)
✓ Clear naming conventions
✓ JONSWAP format (transparent wave data)
✓ Multiple return periods (1yr, 10yr, 100yr)
✓ Industry standard (McDermott convention)
✓ Complete documentation

IMPACT OF ARCHIVAL:
- No impact on current workflow
- All analysis models reference base_files/, not modules/
- All functionality preserved and enhanced
- New structure is production-ready

RESTORATION (if needed):
To restore old structure:
  cd projects/TEST_OPERABILITY/orcaflex
  mv _archived/modules_old_structure_20251111 modules

However, this is NOT recommended as the new structure is superior in all aspects.

DOCUMENTATION:
