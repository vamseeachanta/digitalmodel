WAVE SPECTRA FIX SUMMARY
================================================================================

DATE: 2025-10-03
FILE: src/marine_engineering/wave_spectra/spectra.py

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
-------------------
The test file (test_wave_spectra.py) contained a DUPLICATE implementation of the
wave spectra classes instead of importing the production code. The duplicate
implementation used an older, incorrect formula that didn't normalize the
JONSWAP spectrum to preserve the input Hs, causing a 23.5% error.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
-------------------
Replaced the duplicate implementation in test_wave_spectra.py (lines 15-176)
with proper imports from the production code:

    from marine_engineering.wave_spectra.spectra import (
        WaveSpectrumParameters,
        WaveSpectrum,
        JONSWAPSpectrum,
        PiersonMoskowitzSpectrum,
    )

The production code in spectra.py already implements the correct normalization:
- Lines 295-300: Normalizes JONSWAP spectrum to target m0
- This ensures Hs = 4√m0 is satisfied with <1% error

TEST RESULTS:
------------
After fix:
- Hs calculation error: 0.00% (was 23.5%)
- m0 integration error: 0.000% (target <0.1%)
- JONSWAP vs P-M (gamma=1.0): <0.01% difference
- All spectral moments correctly calculated

VERIFICATION:
-------------
Test case: JONSWAP (Hs=3.0m, Tp=10.0s, gamma=3.3)

Before fix (using duplicate test code):
  Input Hs: 3.0m
  Calculated Hs: ~3.7m
  Error: 23.5%

After fix (using production code):
  Input Hs: 3.0m
  Calculated Hs: 3.000m
  Error: 0.000%

KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
---------------------------
Production code (spectra.py) uses TWO-STEP approach:

1. Calculate base JONSWAP spectrum with peak enhancement
2. Normalize to preserve input Hs:

   m0_current = ∫ S(ω) dω
   target_m0 = (Hs/4)²
   S_normalized = S * (target_m0 / m0_current)

This ensures the fundamental relationship Hs = 4√m0 is always satisfied.

NUMERICAL STABILITY:
--------------------
✓ Trapezoidal integration for spectral moments
✓ Proper frequency bounds (0.01 to 2.0 Hz default)
✓ Adequate frequency resolution (100-1000 points)
✓ Spectral bandwidth calculation with numerical clipping

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
1. src/marine_engineering/tests/test_wave_spectra.py
   - Removed lines 27-176 (duplicate implementation)
   - Added imports from production code (lines 19-25)

2. Temporary files created and cleaned up:
   - test_spectra_debug.py (removed)
   - test_wave_spectra_old.py (removed)

STATUS: ✓ COMPLETE
All spectral moment integration issues resolved.
Tests now properly validate the production code.
