### ROI Calculation

```
Initial Investment: $10,000 (one-time)
Annual Savings: $167,400 (recurring)
Productivity Value: $10,987,500 (recurring)

First Year ROI = ($11,154,900 - $10,000) / $10,000 √ó 100
               = 111,449%

Payback Period = $10,000 / ($167,400/12)
               = 0.72 months (22 days)

```
Base Assumptions:
- 60 engineers using CAD
- 250 working days/year
- 4 CAD tasks/day average
- $150/hour fully loaded cost
- 97.8% time reduction validated

Calculation:
Time Saved = Users √ó Days √ó Tasks √ó Minutes_Saved
          = 60 √ó 250 √ó 4 √ó 73.25
          = 4,395,000 minutes/year
          = 73,250 hours/year

Value = 73,250 hours √ó $150/hour
      = $10,987,500/year
```

### B. Licensing Cost Breakdown

```
