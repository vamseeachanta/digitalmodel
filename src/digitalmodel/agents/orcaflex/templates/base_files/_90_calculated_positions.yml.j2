# Calculated anchor positions based on equal spacing
# Mooring lines arranged in a circular pattern around the vessel

# Mooring angle spacing: {{ 360.0 / num_mooring_lines }} degrees

{% for i in range(1, num_mooring_lines + 1) -%}
{% set angle = (i - 1) * 360.0 / num_mooring_lines -%}
# Mooring{{ i }} - {{ angle }} degrees
{% endfor %}

# Note: Actual anchor positions are calculated in 05_lines.yml
# This file serves as documentation of the mooring layout
