# FreeCAD + Blender Pilot Program - User Onboarding

## Welcome to the Pilot Program!

You are the first user testing the FreeCAD + Blender engineering workflow. This guide will help you get started with practical examples.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### 1. Test Your Installation
```bash
cd /mnt/github/github/digitalmodel/src/modules/design-tools
python3 workflow_test.py
```

### 2. Run Your First Design
```python
# Simple pressure vessel design
from freecad_integration import FreeCADWorkflow

workflow = FreeCADWorkflow("my_first_vessel")
doc = workflow.create_document()
vessel = workflow.create_pressure_vessel(diameter=1000, length=2000, thickness=10)
workflow.export_for_blender("STL")
print("‚úÖ First design complete! Check exports/ folder")
```

### 3. Create Your First Visualization
```python
# Import and render your design
from blender_integration import BlenderWorkflow

viz = BlenderWorkflow("my_first_render")
viz.create_engineering_scene()
viz.render_technical_views(['PNG'])
print("‚úÖ Renders complete! Check renders/ folder")
```

## üìã Your First Week Tasks

### Day 1: Basic Familiarization
- [ ] Run the workflow test to verify installation
- [ ] Create a simple cylinder in FreeCAD
- [ ] Export to STL and view the file
- [ ] Import into Blender and render a basic view

### Day 2: Pressure Vessel Design
- [ ] Design a pressure vessel with your specifications
- [ ] Apply AI optimization for weight reduction
- [ ] Export for visualization
- [ ] Generate technical documentation views

### Day 3: Piping System
- [ ] Create a piping system with elbows and connections
- [ ] Test parametric modifications
- [ ] Export complete assembly
- [ ] Create an assembly animation in Blender

### Day 4: Real Project Test
- [ ] Take an existing project requirement
- [ ] Recreate it using the FreeCAD + Blender workflow
- [ ] Compare time and quality to previous methods
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements needed

### Day 5: Advanced Features

## üéØ Test Scenarios Prepared for You

We've created three real-world test cases for you to practice with:

1. **Offshore Separator Vessel** - Complete with internals and nozzles
2. **Subsea Piping Manifold** - Complex piping arrangement with valves
3. **Equipment Skid Package** - Multiple components on a structural frame

Each test case includes:
- Design specifications
- Expected outputs
- Validation criteria
- Time benchmarks

---

## üìä Feedback Collection

Please track the following metrics during your pilot:

### Time Metrics
- Time to complete each design task
- Time saved vs traditional CAD methods
- Learning curve duration

### Quality Metrics
- Design accuracy achieved
- Visualization quality rating (1-10)
- Documentation completeness

### Usability Metrics
- Ease of use rating (1-10)
- Most useful features
- Missing features or capabilities
- Integration pain points

### Performance Metrics
- File sizes generated
- Processing/rendering times
- System resource usage

---

## üÜò Support Resources

### Immediate Help
- **Quick Reference**: Check `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
- **Test Scripts**: Use `workflow_test.py` to verify functionality
- **Example Code**: Review integration modules for usage patterns

### Common Issues & Solutions

**FreeCAD won't import**
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/lib/freecad-python3/lib')
import FreeCAD
```

**Blender runs but no output**
- Check that you're using `--background` flag
- Verify export paths are absolute, not relative

**Scale issues between programs**
- FreeCAD exports in mm, Blender imports in m
- Apply 0.001 scale factor when importing STL

### Daily Check-ins
We'll review your progress daily and address any issues:
- Morning: Review previous day's work
- Afternoon: Troubleshoot any blockers
- End of day: Document lessons learned

---

## üìà Success Criteria

Your pilot will be considered successful if you can:

1. **Complete all 3 test cases** within the week
2. **Achieve 80% time savings** on at least one task
3. **Rate usability 7/10 or higher** 
4. **Successfully generate** professional documentation
5. **Identify 3+ improvement opportunities** for the workflow

---

## üéâ Pilot Incentives

As our first pilot user, you'll receive:
- **Priority support** for any issues encountered
- **Input on feature development** for next version
- **Recognition as early adopter** in documentation
- **First access** to AI enhancement modules
