# 🚀 AI CAD Pilot - Quick Reference Card

## Start Your Testing Session

```bash
# 1. Launch AI CAD Agent
cd /mnt/github/github/digitalmodel/src/modules/design-tools
python3 ai_cad_agent.py

# 2. Track your progress
cd pilot_program
python3 pilot_dashboard.py
```

## 🤖 AI Commands to Try

### Basic Designs
```
create a pressure vessel 2 meters diameter and 4 meters long
design a separator tank with 20mm walls for offshore use
build a piping system 100 feet long with 8 inch diameter
make a storage tank 3m diameter and 6m tall
```

### Optimization
```
optimize the design for weight
reduce material usage
minimize stress concentrations
optimize for cost
```

### Visualization
```
render a technical view
create a presentation render
show me the front view
generate an isometric view
```

### Analysis
```
analyze the design
calculate volume and weight
check ASME compliance
estimate fabrication time
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Natural Language Works**: Just describe what you want
2. **Units Flexible**: Use meters, feet, inches, mm - AI understands
3. **Be Specific**: "2m diameter" better than "large"
4. **Industry Terms**: Use "separator", "manifold", "vessel"
5. **Iterate Quickly**: "make it 20% larger", "reduce thickness"

## 🆘 Quick Fixes

```python
# If imports fail
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/lib/freecad-python3/lib')

# Scale correction (mm to m)
scale = 0.001

# Clear screen
import os
os.system('clear')
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these for your report:
- **Time Saved**: Target 50%+ vs traditional
- **Quality**: Rate 1-10 for each design
- **Ease of Use**: Rate 1-10 overall
- **Commands/Hour**: Track productivity
