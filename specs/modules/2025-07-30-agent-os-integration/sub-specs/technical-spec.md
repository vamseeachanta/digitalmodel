# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Agent OS Directory Structure**: Create `.agent-os/` directory structure without conflicting with existing offshore engineering project organization
- **Python Integration**: Ensure Agent OS workflows work with existing Python 3.x environment and conda package management for digital engineering
- **YAML Configuration Compatibility**: Maintain full compatibility with existing YAML configuration system used by offshore engineering applications
- **Testing Framework Preservation**: Integrate with existing pytest framework without modifying current test structures for engineering models
- **Digital Engineering Stack**: Ensure compatibility with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and other offshore engineering dependencies
- **CAD/FEA Tool Integration**: Preserve existing integration patterns with OrcaFlex, ANSYS, and other digital modeling tools
- **Database Integration**: Maintain existing database connection patterns for engineering data storage and retrieval
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure Agent OS workflows work across Windows, Linux, macOS for distributed offshore engineering teams
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate documentation for digital engineering models and analytical calculations
- **Multi-Application Architecture**: Support development workflows that span digital modeling, FEA analysis, and CAD integration applications
- **Offshore Engineering Standards**: Maintain compliance with API, DNV, ABS, and other offshore engineering standards

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Comprehensive Agent OS Integration with Full Digital Engineering Adaptation
- Pros: Complete Agent OS feature set, standardized workflows, comprehensive offshore engineering documentation
- Cons: May require significant adaptation period, potential conflicts with established offshore engineering practices
- Implementation: Install complete Agent OS with custom templates for digital modeling and offshore engineering

**Option B:** Selective Agent OS Integration with Offshore Engineering Focus (Selected)
- Pros: Minimal disruption to existing digital engineering workflows, preserves all offshore engineering practices, targeted adoption
- Cons: May not utilize full Agent OS capabilities initially, gradual learning curve
- Implementation: Install core Agent OS components with offshore engineering-specific customizations and templates

**Option C:** Phased Implementation with Digital Engineering Pilot
- Pros: Risk mitigation through phased approach, allows for offshore engineering team feedback and adaptation
- Cons: Longer implementation timeline, requires careful coordination between phases
- Implementation: Install Agent OS in phases starting with documentation and spec creation

**Rationale:** Option B provides the optimal integration path for a mature offshore engineering platform with complex digital modeling workflows. It allows the distributed engineering team to adopt Agent OS practices gradually while preserving all existing digital engineering functionality, CAD integrations, and offshore engineering compliance requirements.

## External Dependencies

- **Agent OS Core** - Core Agent OS framework for development workflows
  - **Justification:** Required for structured development practices and offshore engineering documentation generation
- **No Additional Python Packages** - Integration should use existing Python environment
  - **Justification:** Preserve existing conda environment and avoid conflicts with digital engineering dependencies
- **Markdown Processing Tools** - For documentation generation (likely already available)
  - **Justification:** Required for automatic documentation generation of offshore engineering models and calculations
- **Git Integration Tools** - For trunk-based development workflow
  - **Justification:** Essential for distributed offshore engineering team collaboration
