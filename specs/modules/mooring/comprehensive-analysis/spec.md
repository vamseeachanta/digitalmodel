## Overview

Implement a comprehensive analysis module for OrcaFlex mooring systems that processes CSV output files to assess pretension convergence, stiffness characteristics, and fender forces, providing automated group comparisons and multi-level summaries. This module will reduce analysis time from hours to minutes while providing consistent, intelligent insights using LLM-powered context extraction from filenames.

## User Stories

### Marine Engineer Story

As a marine engineer, I want to automatically analyze multiple mooring analysis runs, so that I can quickly identify convergence issues, assess system stiffness, and evaluate fender utilization without manual CSV file review.

The workflow involves:
1. Point the tool at a directory containing OrcaFlex CSV outputs
2. Automatically group related runs based on filename patterns
3. Receive comprehensive summaries at individual, group, and overall levels
4. Get actionable recommendations based on industry standards

### Project Manager Story

As a project manager, I want to compare different mooring configurations and environmental conditions, so that I can make informed design decisions based on quantitative performance metrics.

The workflow involves:
1. Review group comparison tables and rankings
2. Identify best-performing configurations
3. Understand sensitivity to environmental conditions
4. Export reports for stakeholder communication

### Analysis Automation Story

As an analysis engineer, I want the system to intelligently understand context from filenames, so that appropriate industry standards and vessel-specific criteria are automatically applied.

The workflow involves:
1. LLM extracts vessel type, water depth, and conditions from filenames
2. Appropriate standards (DNV-OS-E301, API RP 2SK) are applied
3. Context-aware thresholds and recommendations are generated
4. Batch processing of 100+ files completes in under 60 seconds

## Spec Scope

1. **Pretension Analysis** - Parse CSV files to assess tension convergence, identify problem lines, and calculate statistical metrics
2. **Stiffness Analysis** - Construct 6-DOF stiffness matrices, compute natural periods, and evaluate system restoring characteristics
3. **Fender Force Analysis** - Analyze fender utilization, load sharing, and identify critical/overloaded fenders
4. **Group Comparison** - Automatically identify run groups from filename patterns and perform cross-group statistical analysis
5. **Multi-Level Summarization** - Generate individual run summaries, group comparisons, and overall system conclusions
6. **Context Extraction** - Use LLM to extract vessel type, environmental conditions, and loading states from filenames
7. **Report Generation** - Create markdown reports with embedded visualizations, tables, and actionable recommendations
8. **Batch Processing** - Parallel processing of multiple CSV files with progress tracking and error handling

## Out of Scope

- Direct integration with OrcaFlex API (future enhancement)
- Real-time monitoring during OrcaFlex runs
- Modification of OrcaFlex models
- Machine learning predictions (future enhancement)
- Web-based dashboard (future enhancement)
- Database storage of historical results (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Python module that processes OrcaFlex CSV outputs for pretension, stiffness, and fender force analysis with 99.9% parsing accuracy
2. Automated group comparison system that identifies patterns and trends across multiple analysis runs
3. Comprehensive markdown reports with embedded visualizations showing convergence plots, stiffness matrices, and fender utilization charts
4. Command-line interface supporting batch processing of 100+ files in under 60 seconds
5. Context-aware analysis applying appropriate industry standards based on vessel type and conditions
