Thank you for that comprehensive research on Rhino's mesh export formats! You've compiled an excellent reference covering all the major categories. Let me help you create a well-structured markdown document that organizes this information effectively.I've created a comprehensive markdown guide that organizes all the Rhino mesh export information you researched. The document includes:

**Key Features:**
- **Structured organization** by format category and use case
- **Detailed format descriptions** with features, limitations, and best uses
- **Export considerations** covering technical aspects
- **Format selection guidelines** for different workflows
- **Version compatibility notes**

**Well-organized sections:**
- Primary formats (STL, OBJ, PLY, etc.)
- Specialized formats (VRML, COLLADA, etc.)
- 3D printing specific formats
- Point cloud and scanner formats
- CAD exchange formats
- New Rhino 8 formats (USD, glTF)

The guide provides practical guidance for choosing the right format based on your specific needs, whether for 3D printing, rendering, game development, CAD integration, or research applications.

Would you like me to add any additional information, such as:
- Specific export settings recommendations for each format?
- Troubleshooting common export issues?
- File size and performance comparisons?
- Integration with OrcaWave or other specific software?
