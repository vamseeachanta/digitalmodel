## Implementation Order

The recommended implementation order considering dependencies:

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation** (Tasks 1-2): Establish core format and library
2. **Phase 2 - Initial Integration** (Tasks 3-4): Implement Rhino3D and OrcaWave converters
3. **Phase 3 - Quality Assurance** (Task 5): Build comprehensive testing framework
4. **Phase 4 - Research** (Task 6): Investigate additional tool integrations
5. **Phase 5 - Documentation** (Task 7): Create user and developer documentation
6. **Phase 6 - Deployment** (Task 8): Package and distribute the solution

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Successfully convert complex vessel geometry from Rhino3D to OrcaWave
- [ ] Maintain geometry fidelity within 0.001mm tolerance
- [ ] Process 100MB models in under 10 seconds
- [ ] Pass all validation tests for both tools
- [ ] Complete documentation for users and developers
- [ ] Establish clear pathways for AutoCAD, SolidWorks, FreeCAD, and Blender integration
