# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Software Interchangeability Format
> Created: 2025-08-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Develop a universal software interchangeability format system that enables seamless data exchange between engineering design tools, starting with Rhino3D and OrcaWave, then expanding to AutoCAD, SolidWorks, FreeCAD, and Blender. This system will establish standardized data structures and conversion protocols to facilitate multi-tool workflows in offshore engineering and design projects.

## User Stories

### Engineering Designer Workflow

As an offshore engineering designer, I want to create geometry in Rhino3D and seamlessly transfer it to OrcaWave for hydrodynamic analysis, so that I can leverage the best features of each tool without manual data re-entry.

The workflow begins with creating a vessel hull or offshore structure in Rhino3D using NURBS surfaces. The designer exports the model through our interchangeability format, which preserves critical geometric properties, material assignments, and metadata. The format automatically handles coordinate system transformations, unit conversions, and mesh generation parameters. When imported into OrcaWave, the geometry is ready for panel mesh generation with preserved structural boundaries and load application points.

### Multi-Tool Pipeline Integration

As a project engineer, I want to maintain a single source of truth for geometry that can be used across multiple analysis tools, so that design changes propagate automatically through the entire analysis workflow.

The system maintains a central interchange format that acts as a hub for all connected software. When geometry is updated in any tool, the changes are captured in the interchange format with version tracking. Other tools in the pipeline can subscribe to changes and automatically update their models. This eliminates the error-prone process of manually updating geometry across multiple software packages.

### Research and Development Flexibility

As a research engineer, I want to experiment with different CAD and analysis tools without being locked into proprietary formats, so that I can evaluate new software and methodologies efficiently.

The interchange format provides a vendor-neutral representation of engineering data. Researchers can quickly prototype workflows using open-source tools like FreeCAD and Blender, then transition to commercial tools like SolidWorks or AutoCAD for production work. The format maintains fidelity across this spectrum, preserving design intent and analysis requirements.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Interchange Format Definition** - Design and implement a schema-based interchange format supporting geometry, materials, metadata, and analysis parameters
2. **Rhino3D Integration Module** - Develop import/export plugins for Rhino3D with full NURBS surface support and layer preservation
3. **OrcaWave Integration Module** - Create bidirectional data exchange with OrcaWave including panel mesh generation and hydrodynamic property mapping
4. **Validation and Testing Framework** - Build comprehensive validation tools to ensure data integrity across conversions
5. **Documentation and Standards** - Establish format specifications, API documentation, and best practices for extending the system

## Out of Scope

- Real-time synchronization between applications (future enhancement)
- Direct API integration with cloud-based CAD systems
- Automated optimization workflows between tools
- Proprietary format reverse engineering
- Rendering and visualization properties (focus on engineering data)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional interchange format library with Python API for reading/writing the format
2. Working Rhino3D plugin that exports/imports the interchange format with full geometry fidelity
3. OrcaWave integration module handling mesh generation and hydrodynamic model setup
4. Comprehensive test suite with sample models demonstrating Rhino3D to OrcaWave workflow
5. Format specification document detailing schema, supported features, and extension mechanisms
6. Research report on AutoCAD, SolidWorks, FreeCAD, and Blender integration pathways
