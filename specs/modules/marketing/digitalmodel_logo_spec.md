# Digital Model Logo Design Brief

## 1. Background & Context
- **Product**: Digital Model – engineering asset lifecycle management platform focused on offshore, subsea, and marine systems.
- **Mission**: Deliver a single source of truth (ASCII-first) that drives analytical calculations, FE models, CAD/animation, and documentation with rigorous QA.
- **Positioning**: Trusted, engineering-grade toolkit blending deep industry expertise with modern automation for sustainable energy infrastructure.
- **Heritage**: Dedicated to Mark Cerkovnik (Chief Engineer); incorporate respectful nod to engineering mentorship without becoming commemorative.

## 2. Brand Personality & Attributes
| Pillar | Keywords | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Engineering Authority | Precise, Verified, Robust | Logo should feel dependable, not playful. |
| Digital Thread | Connected, Adaptive, Modular | Convey data flow or layered system. |
| Offshore Heritage | Marine, Structural, Resilient | Subtle maritime reference (waves, riser, buoy) without cliché anchors. |
| Sustainability | Enduring, Responsible | Use modern yet muted palette; avoid fossil-centric motifs. |

## 3. Visual Direction
- **Form Language**: Geometric, clean lines; avoid high-detail illustration. Consider modular shapes forming an abstract “D” or “DM” intertwined with a pipeline/riser curve.
- **Icon + Wordmark**: Prefer icon that can stand alone (favicon, badges) paired with custom or semi-custom logotype for “Digital Model”.
- **Typography Inspiration**: Humanist or neo-grotesque sans serif (e.g., Inter, Neue Haas Grotesk) with engineering precision—no overly rounded tech fonts.
- **Color Exploration**:
  - Primary candidates: Deep marine blue/navy (authority), teal or sea-glass green (sustainability), slate gray (engineering baseline).
  - Accent pop: Soft amber or coral for highlighting energy transition if needed.
  - Ensure accessibility contrast for light/dark backgrounds.
- **Graphic Motifs**: Data streams, sectional layers, waveforms, or node networks that can hint at ASCII schematics.
- **Avoid**: Literal oil rigs, propellers, aggressive gradients, or meme-style tech marks.

## 4. Usage Scenarios
1. GitHub avatar / social icon (512×512, 128×128, 32×32).
2. Documentation header (landscape lockup).
3. Presentation slides & reports (light + dark backgrounds).
4. Favicon & CLI badge.
5. Potential embroidery / low-color applications.

## 5. Deliverables
- Primary horizontal logo (icon + wordmark).
- Stacked/vertical variation.
- Icon-only mark.
- Light & dark theme versions.
- Black & white / single-color versions.
- Clear-space & minimum-size guidelines.
- Color palette and typography recommendations.
- Export formats: SVG (preferred), PNG (@1x, @2x, @4x), PDF. Optional: monochrome EPS for print.
- Usage sheet summarizing do/don’t examples.

## 6. Constraints & Requirements
- Must remain legible at 24px height (CLI badge).
- Icon should scale to 16×16 favicon while retaining recognizable silhouette.
- Respect MIT-license friendly assets; ensure all components are original or open-licensed with attribution.
- Align with existing docs aesthetic (clean, minimal). Avoid gradients heavier than two-stop ramp.
- Keep color count <= 4 in the primary lockup.

## 7. Research Inputs
- Review architecture diagram (`docs/digital_model_architecure.svg`) for layering motifs.
- Explore existing module icons (if any) for alignment; no direct reuse required.
- Consider referencing ASCII schematics or wave spectra charts to inspire patterning.

## 8. Stakeholders & Review
- Creative brief owner: Digital Model maintainers (core engineering team).
- Engineering review: ensure technical symbolism resonates with offshore engineers.
- Branding review rounds: 
  1. Moodboards / sketches
  2. Refined concepts (2–3 options)
  3. Final polish + delivery

## 9. Timeline (suggested)
| Phase | Duration | Notes |
| ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Discovery & moodboard | 1 week | Gather references, approve direction. |
| Concept exploration | 1–2 weeks | Present multiple logo options. |
| Refinement & QA | 1 week | Iterate based on feedback. |
| Asset handoff | 2–3 days | Package files + guidelines. |

## 10. Success Criteria
- Visually communicates fusion of engineering rigor and digital connectivity.
- Works across documentation, code repositories, and presentations with minimal adjustments.
- Receives approval from both branding and engineering stakeholders.
- Future-friendly: icon can expand into product module badges without redesign.
