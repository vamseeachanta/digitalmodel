- Integration tests with real specifications and code
- Performance benchmarks with regression detection
- Security testing for all code generation features

### Documentation Standards
- Follow Agent OS communication guidelines (no banned words/phrases)
- Include executable code examples
- Provide clear troubleshooting guidance
- Maintain cross-references to related agents

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Tasks
- **Multi-agent coordination** (Task 1.1, 5.1): Complex inter-agent communication
- **Parallel test execution** (Task 3.2): Resource management and synchronization
- **Automated refactoring** (Task 4.2): Code safety and test preservation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Use incremental development with frequent testing
- Create safety checks for all automated code modifications
- Include extensive validation at each integration point

## Success Criteria

1. **Agent Functionality**: All three agents operational with core features
2. **Integration**: Seamless integration with Agent OS ecosystem
3. **Performance**: 3-5x speedup through parallelization
4. **Quality**: &gt;95% test coverage and quality metrics &gt;80
5. **Usability**: Clear documentation and examples for adoption

## Effort Summary

- **Total Estimated Hours**: 79-99 hours
- **Parallel Development Opportunities**: Phase 2, 3, and 4 can partially overlap
- **Critical Path**: Phase 1 (foundation) must complete before other phases
- **Testing Integration**: Continuous testing throughout all phases

## Dependencies

All dependencies managed through UV:
```bash
uv add pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov pytest-mock pytest-benchmark
uv add hypothesis factory-boy black isort mypy flake8 pylint bandit radon vulture
uv add GitPython semver Jinja2 PyYAML rich
```

**Next Step**: Begin with Phase 1 foundation tasks, establishing base infrastructure before implementing individual agents.
