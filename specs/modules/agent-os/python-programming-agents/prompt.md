# Python Programming Agents - Prompt History

> Created: 2025-08-31
> Specification: python-programming-agents
> Status: Initial Creation

## Original Request

**User Request:**
```
Create the complete specification structure for task-dedicated Python programming agents in specs/modules/agent-os/python-programming-agents/. The spec should cover three main agent types:

1. Specification Iteration Agent - for recycling and updating specifications with modified requirements
2. Test-Driven Development Agent - for TDD practices and test automation  
3. Clean Code/Refactor Agent - for code quality and refactoring

Create all required files:
- spec.md with complete specification
- tasks.md with detailed task breakdown
- prompt.md with prompt history
- task_summary.md with executive summary

Make sure to:
- Document best tools and practices for each agent
- Utilize existing repo ecosystem (uv environment, verification hooks, etc.)
- Include inter-agent delegation patterns
- Follow all mandatory patterns from CLAUDE.md
- Include parallel processing strategies
- Reference existing agent patterns from the production agents
```

## Context Analysis

### Repository Examination
Before creating the specification, I analyzed the existing repository structure:

1. **Examined Agent Patterns**: Reviewed `agents/testing/` and `agents/code_quality/` for existing patterns
2. **Standards Review**: Analyzed `.agent-os/standards/ai-communication.md` for communication requirements
3. **Spec Structure**: Reviewed existing specification at `specs/modules/context-extraction/file-type-agents/spec.md`
4. **Code Style**: Examined `.agent-os/standards/code-style.md` for formatting requirements

### Key Requirements Identified
From CLAUDE.md analysis, identified mandatory requirements:
- **UV Environment Usage**: ALL operations must use `uv run` or UV environment
- **No Mock Testing**: NEVER create mock tests unless explicitly requested
- **Verification Hooks**: ALL outputs must integrate with Agent OS verification hooks
- **Inter-Agent Delegation**: MANDATORY inter-agent communication and task routing
- **Parallel Processing**: Must utilize parallel execution for performance
- **No Sycophancy**: Clear, direct communication following anti-sycophancy guidelines

## Specification Design Decisions

### 1. Agent Architecture
**Decision**: Three specialized agents with common base class
**Rationale**: 
- Maintains code reuse through inheritance
- Enables specialized capabilities per domain
- Supports inter-agent delegation patterns

### 2. Tool Selection Criteria
**Decision**: Focus on production-ready Python tools with UV integration
**Rationale**:
- Tools must integrate with UV package management
- Production-proven tools reduce implementation risk
- Comprehensive coverage across testing, analysis, and formatting

### 3. Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Deep integration with existing Agent OS ecosystem
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing verification hooks infrastructure
- Maintains consistency with repository patterns
- Enables seamless adoption by existing workflows

## Agent Specifications

### Specification Iteration Agent
**Purpose**: Evolve specifications with changing requirements while maintaining traceability

**Key Tools Selected**:
- `GitPython`: For change history analysis and version control integration
- `Jinja2`: Template engine for specification generation
- `difflib`: Built-in library for change detection
- `semver`: Semantic versioning for specification evolution

**Design Principles**:
- Requirement change tracking with full audit trail
- Automated specification regeneration with consistency validation
- Version management with rollback capabilities

### Test-Driven Development Agent
**Purpose**: Comprehensive TDD implementation with parallel execution

**Key Tools Selected**:
- `pytest` ecosystem: Core testing framework with extensions
- `pytest-xdist`: Mandatory for parallel test execution
- `hypothesis`: Property-based testing for edge case coverage
- `pytest-cov`: Coverage analysis and gap detection

**Design Principles**:
- Intelligent test generation from specifications
- Parallel execution with resource optimization
- Continuous feedback and real-time reporting

### Clean Code/Refactor Agent
**Purpose**: Automated code quality analysis and safe refactoring

**Key Tools Selected**:
- `black`, `isort`: Formatting automation
- `mypy`, `pylint`, `flake8`: Multi-layered analysis
- `bandit`: Security vulnerability detection
- `radon`: Complexity analysis and technical debt

**Design Principles**:
- Safe refactoring with test preservation
- Multi-dimensional quality analysis
- Automated improvement with human oversight

## Inter-Agent Delegation Design

### Delegation Matrix
Created comprehensive delegation matrix showing:
- Task ownership by agent type
- Secondary agent involvement
- Parallel task opportunities

### Communication Protocol
**Decision**: Registry-based agent discovery with capability matching
**Implementation**: `AgentRegistry` class with rule-based delegation

## Parallel Processing Strategy

### Task-Level Parallelization
- Independent task identification and parallel execution
- Resource-aware worker allocation
- Progress tracking and result aggregation

### Agent-Level Parallelization
- Multi-agent coordination for complex workflows
- Dependency analysis and scheduling
- Error propagation and recovery

## Quality Assurance Integration

### 10-Point Skill Assessment
Implemented mandatory agent self-assessment protocol:
- Minimum 70/100 score required for task execution
- Covers 10 skill areas from domain expertise to best practices
- Escalation to specialized agents or user when insufficient

### Testing Strategy
- NO mock testing (following repository mandate)
- Integration tests with real specifications and code
- Performance benchmarks with regression detection
- Security testing for all generated code

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Development
**Phase 1**: Foundation framework with UV integration
**Phase 2-4**: Individual agent implementation (can be parallelized)
**Phase 5**: Integration and optimization
**Phase 6**: Testing and documentation

### Resource Estimation
- Total: 79-99 hours estimated effort
- Critical path: Foundation phase required before agent development
- Parallel development opportunities identified for Phase 2-4

## Curated Reuse Prompt

For reusing or extending this specification:

```
Create Python programming agents following the established Agent OS patterns with:

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- UV environment integration (uv run for all commands)
- Agent OS verification hooks integration
- Inter-agent delegation with capability matching
- Parallel processing for performance (target 3-5x speedup)
- No sycophancy communication style
- 10-point agent self-assessment protocol

AGENT TYPES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Specification Iteration Agent (requirements evolution)
2. TDD Agent (test generation and parallel execution)  
3. Clean Code Agent (quality analysis and refactoring)

TOOLS AND INTEGRATION:
- Use production Python tools (pytest, black, mypy, etc.)
- Integrate with existing .agent-os/hooks/ verification system
- Follow repository module organization: specs/modules/<module>/
- Include comprehensive task breakdown with effort estimates
- Create agent registry for inter-agent communication

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- >95% test coverage with real (not mock) tests
- >80 maintainability index for generated code
- Security analysis passing with no high-severity issues
- Performance benchmarks with regression detection

Reference the existing Agent OS ecosystem and follow established patterns from context-extraction agents while adapting for Python programming workflows.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Repository Structure Understanding**: Critical to examine existing patterns before design
2. **Mandatory Requirements**: CLAUDE.md requirements are non-negotiable and shape architecture
3. **Tool Integration**: UV environment usage affects all dependency and execution decisions
4. **Agent Communication**: Inter-agent delegation requires thoughtful design upfront
5. **Parallel Processing**: Performance requirements drive architectural decisions

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure UV environment with all required dependencies
2. **Foundation Development**: Start with base classes and integration frameworks
3. **Agent Development**: Implement individual agents with parallel development where possible
4. **Testing Integration**: Continuous testing throughout development phases
5. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize parallel processing implementation
