## Task Dependency Verification

Each task explicitly documents its dependencies:
- **Task 1**: Foundation task - no dependencies
- **Task 2**: Depends on Task 1 - system installation required to run analysis
- **Task 3**: Depends on Task 2 - analysis results guide repository configuration  
- **Task 4**: Depends on Task 3 - repository structure required for sub-agents
- **Task 5**: Depends on Task 4 - sub-agents provide automation foundation
- **Task 6**: Depends on Task 5 - git workflow structure required for automation scripts
- **Task 7**: Depends on Task 6 - automation scripts inform template workflow integration
- **Task 8**: Depends on Task 7 - templates and workflows must be established
- **Task 9**: Depends on Task 8 - all components must be implemented before testing
- **Task 10**: Depends on Task 9 - system must be tested and validated before documentation

This ordering minimizes errors, reduces rework, and ensures consistent implementation success across different team members and offshore engineering environments.
