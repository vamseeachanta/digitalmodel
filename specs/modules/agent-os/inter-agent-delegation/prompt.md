# Inter-Agent Delegation System - Prompt Documentation

## Original User Request
"are there any good considerations you suggest"

## Context
User was reviewing the implementation of mandatory inter-agent delegation notes added to CLAUDE.md and agent configurations, specifically around making agents aware of each other and able to delegate tasks appropriately.

## AI Response - Enhancement Suggestions
The AI suggested 10 key enhancements for the inter-agent delegation system:

1. **Agent Capability Registry File** - Central registry.yaml for auto-updating agent capabilities
2. **Circular Delegation Prevention** - Safeguards against infinite delegation loops
3. **Agent Confidence Scoring** - Self-assessment of task handling confidence
4. **Delegation Performance Metrics** - Track and optimize delegation decisions
5. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Secondary options when preferred agents unavailable
6. **Cross-Repository Agent Sharing** - Central agents in AssetUtilities
7. **Task Decomposition Standards** - Standardized task breakdown approach
8. **Agent Communication Protocol** - Defined context passing between agents
9. **Parallel Agent Coordination** - Multi-agent simultaneous execution
10. **Agent Learning & Improvement** - Feedback loops for optimization

## User Follow-up
"/create-spec with these suggested enhancements so we can plan prior to execution"

## Specification Creation Process

### Key Design Decisions Made:
1. **Phased Implementation** - 10 phases over 5 weeks for systematic rollout
2. **Central Registry Architecture** - YAML-based with auto-discovery
3. **Confidence Threshold System** - 0.0-1.0 scoring with configurable thresholds
4. **Three-Level Task Decomposition** - Strategic, Component, Atomic
5. **Async Communication Layer** - Non-blocking inter-agent messaging
6. **Performance Analytics** - Real-time metrics and learning system

### Implementation Priorities:
1. **Critical Path**: Registry → Engine → Updates → Integration
2. **Parallel Opportunities**: Documentation, testing, and monitoring throughout
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Gradual rollout with extensive testing

### Agent Delegation Matrix Established:
- **Engineering Path**: OrcaFlex ↔ OrcaWave ↔ AQWA
- **CAD/FEA Path**: CAD-Engineering → FreeCAD → GMsh → ANSYS
- **Support Path**: Any Agent → Documentation/Testing agents

## Curated Reuse Prompt

### To continue development of the Inter-Agent Delegation System:

```
Continue implementing the Inter-Agent Delegation System as specified in specs/modules/agent-os/inter-agent-delegation/

Current Status:
- Specification complete with 10 enhancement areas
- Task breakdown created with 10 phases over 5 weeks
- ~200 hours estimated effort

Priority Focus Areas:
1. Central agent registry (agents/registry.yaml)
2. Delegation engine with confidence scoring
3. Circular delegation prevention
4. Inter-agent communication protocol
5. Performance metrics and learning system

Key Requirements:
- All agents must maintain awareness of other agents
- Delegation based on confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- Maximum delegation depth of 3 levels
- Fallback mechanisms for unavailable agents
- Cross-repository synchronization via AssetUtilities

Next Steps:
1. Implement Phase 1: Foundation (registry and auto-discovery)
2. Update existing agents with delegation configs
3. Create delegation engine with task decomposition
4. Integrate with slash commands (/create-spec, /create-module-agent, /execute-tasks)

Technical Context:
- Python 3.11+ with async support
- YAML-based configuration
- UV environment for all execution
- Parallel processing for efficiency

Please begin with [specific phase/task] focusing on [specific enhancement].
```

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Agent Discovery** - Must automatically find and register all agents
2. **Confidence Accuracy** - Agents must honestly self-assess capabilities
3. **Performance Impact** - Delegation overhead must be <100ms
4. **User Experience** - Transparent delegation with clear feedback
5. **Learning System** - Continuous improvement from delegation patterns

### Technical Constraints:
- Must work with existing agent architecture
- Cannot break backward compatibility
- Must support cross-repository operations
- Performance requirements: <100ms decision time

### Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for delegation flows
- Performance tests for scale
- Fallback mechanism validation
- Cross-repository sync verification
