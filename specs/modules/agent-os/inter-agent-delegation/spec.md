# Inter-Agent Delegation System Specification

## Overview
A comprehensive system for intelligent task delegation between specialized AI agents, enabling optimal task routing, parallel execution, and cross-repository collaboration across the entire ecosystem.

## Problem Statement
Current agent system operates in silos with:
- No awareness of other agents' capabilities
- Inefficient sequential task execution
- Duplicate effort across similar tasks
- No learning from delegation patterns
- Manual task assignment required

## Proposed Solution
Implement a sophisticated inter-agent delegation system with:
- Central capability registry
- Intelligent task routing
- Confidence-based delegation
- Performance tracking
- Cross-repository agent sharing

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Agent Capability Registry (`agents/registry.yaml`)
Centralized registry maintaining:
- Agent capabilities and specializations
- Confidence scores per domain
- Delegation relationships
- License requirements
- Performance metrics

#### 2. Delegation Protocol Engine
- Task analysis and decomposition
- Agent capability matching
- Confidence scoring
- Circular delegation prevention
- Fallback mechanism handling

#### 3. Communication Protocol
Standardized inter-agent messaging:
- Task context passing
- Artifact sharing
- Progress tracking
- Result aggregation

#### 4. Performance Analytics
- Delegation success tracking
- Time efficiency metrics
- User satisfaction scoring
- Pattern learning system

### Implementation Details

#### Agent Registry Structure
```yaml
registry:
  version: "2.0"
  agents:
    orcaflex:
      path: agents/orcaflex
      specialties: 
        - hydrodynamics: 0.95
        - mooring_analysis: 0.90
        - offshore_engineering: 0.85
      license_required: true
      delegates_to: [orcawave, aqwa]
      fallback_agents: [general-engineering]
      performance:
        success_rate: 0.92
        avg_task_time: 45s
    
    freecad:
      path: agents/freecad
      specialties:
        - parametric_modeling: 0.95
        - assembly_design: 0.90
        - technical_drawings: 0.85
      license_required: false
      delegates_to: [gmsh, cad-engineering-specialist]
      fallback_agents: [cad-engineering-specialist]
```

#### Delegation Decision Engine
```python
class DelegationEngine:
    def analyze_task(self, task):
        # 1. Decompose task into subtasks
        # 2. Match subtasks to agent capabilities
        # 3. Calculate confidence scores
        # 4. Check for circular dependencies
        # 5. Create delegation plan
        # 6. Return optimized execution path
```

#### Task Decomposition Standards
```yaml
task_structure:
  level_1: # Strategic objective
    description: "Complete CAD to FEA workflow"
    owner: orchestrator
    
  level_2: # Component tasks (delegatable)
    - task: "Create parametric model"
      delegate_to: freecad
      confidence_required: 0.7
    - task: "Generate mesh"
      delegate_to: gmsh
      confidence_required: 0.8
      
  level_3: # Atomic operations
    - operation: "Define geometry parameters"
    - operation: "Apply constraints"
    - operation: "Export STEP file"
```

## Agent Delegation Mapping

### Primary Delegation Routes
1. **Engineering Analysis Path**
   - OrcaFlex → OrcaWave (wave data)
   - OrcaFlex → AQWA (verification)
   - AQWA → OrcaFlex (loads)

2. **CAD/FEA Path**
   - CAD-Engineering → FreeCAD (modeling)
   - FreeCAD → GMsh (meshing)
   - GMsh → ANSYS (analysis)

3. **Documentation Path**
   - Any Agent → Documentation Agent
   - Documentation → Testing Agent (examples)

### Delegation Rules
```yaml
delegation_rules:
  - condition: "task contains 'mesh'"
    primary: gmsh
    fallback: cad-engineering-specialist
    min_confidence: 0.7
    
  - condition: "task contains 'hydrodynamic'"
    primary: orcaflex
    fallback: aqwa
    min_confidence: 0.8
    
  - condition: "task contains 'parametric'"
    primary: freecad
    fallback: cad-engineering-specialist
    min_confidence: 0.6
```

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Confidence-Based Routing
Agents self-assess capability:
- Score 0.0-1.0 per task type
- Delegate if score < threshold
- Learn from outcomes

### 2. Circular Delegation Prevention
- Track delegation chain
- Max depth: 3 levels
- Visited agents list
- Fail-safe to user

### 3. Parallel Coordination
- Dependency graph creation
- Parallel execution planning
- Resource allocation
- Result synchronization

### 4. Performance Metrics
Track per delegation:
- Success/failure rate
- Time to completion
- User satisfaction
- Resource usage

### 5. Learning System
- Pattern recognition
- Rule optimization
- Confidence adjustment
- Cross-repo sharing

### 6. Fallback Mechanisms
When primary agent unavailable:
- Secondary agent selection
- Capability degradation handling
- User notification
- Manual override option

### 7. Cross-Repository Integration
- Central registry in AssetUtilities
- Local agent proxies
- Version compatibility
- Synchronized updates

### 8. Communication Protocol
```yaml
message_format:
  header:
    from_agent: string
    to_agent: string
    task_id: uuid
    timestamp: datetime
    
  context:
    original_request: string
    completed_work: array
    remaining_tasks: array
    constraints: object
    
  artifacts:
    files: array
    configs: object
    results: object
    
  delegation:
    confidence: float
    reason: string
    fallback_used: boolean
```

## Integration Requirements

### Slash Command Updates
1. `/create-spec` modifications:
   - Auto-scan agent registry
   - Generate delegation mapping
   - Include in spec.md

2. `/create-module-agent` modifications:
   - Register with central registry
   - Discover existing agents
   - Configure delegation rules

3. `/execute-tasks` modifications:
   - Use delegation engine
   - Track performance
   - Update metrics

### Agent Configuration Updates
Each agent's `agent_config.yaml` must include:
```yaml
delegation:
  capabilities:
    domain_1: confidence_score
    domain_2: confidence_score
  delegates_to: [agent_list]
  accepts_from: [agent_list]
  communication_protocol: "v2.0"
```

## Security Considerations
- Agent authentication
- Task authorization
- Resource limits
- Audit logging
- Sensitive data handling

## Performance Requirements
