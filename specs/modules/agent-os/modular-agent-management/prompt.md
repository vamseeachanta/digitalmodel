## Curated Reuse Prompt

### For Similar Specifications
```
Create a comprehensive modular agent management system specification that:
1. Establishes specialized AI agents for each module and submodule to optimize context and execution speed
2. Implements automated agent refresh capabilities with /refresh-agent slash command
3. Integrates with existing /create-spec workflow to automatically reference appropriate agents
4. Follows repository module-based organization pattern (specs/modules/<module>/)
5. Includes detailed 4-phase implementation plan with specific tasks and success criteria
6. Provides comprehensive technical architecture and testing specifications
7. Enables cross-module agent collaboration for complex multi-domain features

Key focus areas: context optimization, knowledge currency, automated refresh, integration with existing workflows
```

### Key Parameters
- **Module**: agent-os (core framework module)
- **Scope**: HIGH - Enterprise-level agent management system with automation
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Existing slash command framework
  - Specification generation workflow (/create-spec)
  - Module-based repository structure
  - Cross-module collaboration patterns
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - 90% module coverage with dedicated agents
  - 50% context reduction through focused domains
  - 30% faster execution through specialized expertise
  - 24-hour knowledge refresh cycle

### Reuse Guidelines
- **When to Use**: For creating comprehensive AI agent management or automation systems
- **Customization Points**: 
  - Adjust module coverage percentage based on project size
  - Modify performance targets based on complexity requirements
  - Scale implementation phases based on timeline and resources
- **Common Variations**:
  - Single-module agent systems (reduce scope to Phase 1-2)
  - Cross-repository agent systems (add repository integration phase)
  - Domain-specific agent systems (focus on particular technical domains)

## Lessons Learned
- **Comprehensive Scope Management**: Breaking complex system into 4 clear implementation phases with specific deliverables prevents overwhelming single AI agents
- **Integration-First Approach**: Focusing on integration with existing workflows (slash commands, spec generation) ensures practical adoption
- **Module-Based Organization**: Following repository patterns from the start prevents later refactoring and ensures consistency
- **Performance Metrics**: Including specific, measurable success criteria (50% context reduction, 30% speed improvement) provides clear validation targets
- **Cross-Agent Collaboration**: Planning for multi-domain scenarios from the beginning enables complex real-world use cases
- **Technical Deep Dive**: Separate technical specification enables implementation teams to have detailed guidance without overwhelming the main spec
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Including dedicated test specification ensures system reliability and performance validation

## Prompt History (Reverse Chronological)

### Original Request - 2025-01-25
```
/create-spec create agents as required for modules and submodules (if required to keep context small and faster execution). these agents should reside in agents folder using consistent module architecture. create a slash command /refresh-agent with input parameters as a module or submodule, always keep the ability to refresh agents as new information These agents should be referred in the tasks.md as applicable when creating specs using /create-spec. Seperate this bulk into multiple specs as necessary for ai agent to tackle
```

### Context at Time of Creation
- **Session Context**: Following extensive spec consolidation and repository reorganization work
- **Repository State**: Fresh consolidation of 25+ specifications into module-based structure, established repository pattern
- **Related Work**: 
  - Recent consolidation from `.ai/specs` and `specs` to unified `specs/modules/` structure  
  - Enhanced test-suite-automation spec with coverage framework
  - Established mandatory module-based repository organization pattern
