# Modular Agent Management System

> Spec: Modular Agent Management System  
> Created: 2025-01-25  
> Status: Planning  
> Version: 1.0.0

## Overview

This specification defines a comprehensive modular agent management system that creates specialized AI agents for each module and submodule in the Digital Model project. The system provides intelligent context management, faster execution through focused expertise, and automated agent refresh capabilities to maintain currency with evolving specifications.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story: Module-Specific Agent Creation
**As a** developer working with Digital Model specifications  
**I want** specialized AI agents for each module and submodule  
**So that** I can get focused, expert assistance with faster execution and better context management

### Secondary User Story: Dynamic Agent Refresh
**As a** project maintainer updating specifications  
**I want** to refresh agents when module content changes  
**So that** agents maintain accurate, up-to-date knowledge of their domains

### Tertiary User Story: Spec Creation Integration
**As a** developer creating new specifications  
**I want** `/create-spec` to automatically reference appropriate agents in tasks  
**So that** implementation guidance includes the right domain expertise

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
1. **Modular Agent Architecture**
   - Individual agents for each major module (agent-os, marine-engineering, etc.)
   - Submodule agents for complex modules requiring specialized context
   - Consistent agent template and configuration structure

2. **Agent Management Commands**
   - `/refresh-agent` command for updating agent knowledge
   - Agent discovery and initialization system
   - Agent health monitoring and validation

3. **Specification Integration**
   - Automatic agent references in tasks.md files
   - Integration with existing `/create-spec` command
   - Cross-module agent collaboration patterns

4. **Knowledge Management**
   - Context optimization for each agent domain
   - Automated knowledge refresh from specification updates
   - Agent specialization based on module complexity

### Out of Scope
- Real-time agent communication protocols
- Advanced AI model training or fine-tuning
- Complex multi-agent orchestration workflows
- Agent performance analytics beyond basic monitoring

## Expected Deliverable

### 1. Agent Architecture Framework
- **Location**: `agents/` directory with module-based structure
- **Components**: Agent configuration files, knowledge bases, refresh mechanisms
- **Standards**: Consistent agent templates and initialization patterns

### 2. Agent Management Commands
- **`/refresh-agent`**: Command to update agent knowledge from specifications
- **Agent Discovery**: Automatic detection and initialization of module agents
- **Health Monitoring**: Agent status validation and troubleshooting

### 3. Enhanced Specification Integration
- **Task Generation**: Automatic agent references in tasks.md files
- **Spec Templates**: Updated templates with agent integration patterns
- **Cross-Module Support**: Agent collaboration for multi-domain features

### 4. Implementation Support
- **Documentation**: Agent usage guides and best practices
- **Examples**: Sample agent configurations and use cases
- **Migration**: Tools for transitioning existing specs to agent-enhanced workflow

## Success Metrics

- **Agent Coverage**: 90% of modules have dedicated specialized agents
- **Context Efficiency**: 50% reduction in context size through focused agent domains  
- **Execution Speed**: 30% faster task completion through specialized expertise
- **Knowledge Currency**: Agents refresh within 24 hours of specification updates
- **Integration Rate**: 80% of new specs utilize appropriate agent references

### Agent Specialization Criteria
- **Module Complexity**: Modules with >5 specifications get dedicated agents
- **Domain Expertise**: Engineering domains get specialized technical agents  
- **Update Frequency**: Frequently changing modules get priority refresh
- **Cross-Dependencies**: Modules with many interdependencies get collaboration agents

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Specification Structure**: Leverages consolidated specs/ hierarchy
- **Template System**: Extends existing spec templates with agent references
- **Task Management**: Enhances tasks.md generation with agent assignments
- **Command Framework**: Builds on existing slash command infrastructure

### With Development Workflow
- **Pre-Implementation**: Agents provide domain context before task execution
- **During Implementation**: Agents offer specialized guidance and validation
- **Post-Implementation**: Agents assist with testing and documentation
- **Maintenance**: Agents help with ongoing updates and troubleshooting

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Context Explosion**: Mitigated by focused agent domains and smart refresh
- **Agent Drift**: Mitigated by automated refresh triggers and validation
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigated by phased rollout and existing patterns

### Operational Risks  
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Mitigated by automated refresh and health monitoring
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Mitigated by cross-agent collaboration patterns
- **User Adoption**: Mitigated by seamless integration with existing workflows
