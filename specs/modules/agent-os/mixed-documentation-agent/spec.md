## Context Persistence Strategy

### Knowledge Graph Versioning

#### Version Control Model
Following Git-inspired patterns adapted for graph data structures:

```python
class KnowledgeGraphVersion:
    def __init__(self, commit_hash: str, parent: Optional[str], changes: GraphDelta):
        self.commit_hash = commit_hash
        self.parent = parent
        self.changes = changes
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
        self.metadata = VersionMetadata()
    
    def apply_changes(self, base_graph: KnowledgeGraph) -&gt; KnowledgeGraph:
        return base_graph.apply_delta(self.changes)
```

#### Delta Computation
Efficient representation of graph changes using structural and semantic diffs:
- **Node Changes**: Added, modified, or removed entities and concepts
- **Edge Changes**: New relationships, updated weights, or removed connections
- **Semantic Changes**: Concept definition updates, hierarchy modifications
- **Provenance Updates**: Source document additions or corrections

#### Conflict Resolution
Automated detection and resolution strategies:
1. **Automatic Resolution**: Non-conflicting changes (different subgraphs)
2. **Confidence-Based**: Prefer higher confidence extractions
3. **Temporal Resolution**: Favor more recent document sources
4. **Expert Review**: Human review for complex conflicts

### Incremental Processing Architecture

#### Change Detection
Monitor document collections for additions, modifications, and removals:
```python
class DocumentMonitor:
    def __init__(self, watch_paths: List[Path]):
        self.watch_paths = watch_paths
        self.last_scan = {}
        
    def detect_changes(self) -&gt; DocumentChangeSet:
        current_state = self.scan_documents()
        changes = self.compute_diff(self.last_scan, current_state)
        self.last_scan = current_state
        return changes
```

#### Delta Processing Pipeline
Process only changed documents while maintaining knowledge graph integrity:
1. **Impact Analysis**: Identify affected knowledge subgraphs
2. **Selective Reprocessing**: Extract knowledge only from changed documents
3. **Graph Integration**: Merge new knowledge with existing graph
4. **Validation**: Ensure consistency and resolve conflicts
5. **Commit**: Create new version with complete change tracking

### Caching and Performance Optimization

#### Multi-Level Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache (Redis)**: Frequently accessed knowledge queries (&lt; 1ms response)
- **L2 Cache (Application)**: Preprocessed document content and extraction results
- **L3 Cache (Database)**: Optimized graph indexes and materialized views

#### Query Optimization
