# Fatigue Analysis Tutorial - For Young Engineers

## Welcome! üëã

This tutorial will help you understand fatigue analysis for offshore structures. We'll go from basic concepts to running your first analysis.

## Chapter 1: What is Fatigue?

### The Paper Clip Example
Try this: Take a paper clip and bend it back and forth. After several bends, it breaks! That's fatigue failure - repeated stress causes damage over time, even if each stress is small.

### In Offshore Structures
Ocean waves create cyclic loading on mooring structures:
- Wave goes up ‚Üí Tension increases
- Wave goes down ‚Üí Tension decreases  
- Repeat millions of times ‚Üí Fatigue damage

## Chapter 2: Key Concepts

### 1. Stress Range
The difference between maximum and minimum stress in a cycle.
```
Stress Range = œÉ_max - œÉ_min

Example:
Max tension: 100 MPa
Min tension: 20 MPa
Stress Range = 100 - 20 = 80 MPa
```

### 2. Rainflow Counting
Imagine rain flowing down a pagoda roof - that's how we count stress cycles!
- Converts irregular stress history into simple cycles
- Each cycle has: stress range + number of occurrences
- Output: Histogram of stress ranges vs cycle counts

### 3. S-N Curve (W√∂hler Curve)
Shows relationship between Stress (S) and Number of cycles to failure (N).

```
High Stress ‚Üí Few cycles to failure (like bending paper clip hard)
Low Stress ‚Üí Many cycles to failure (gentle bending)

Our equation: log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(N) = 12.164 - 3.0 √ó log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(S)
```

### 4. Fatigue Limit
Below certain stress (52.64 MPa for our steel), material lasts forever!
Like gently wiggling the paper clip - it won't break.

### 5. Miner's Rule
How we add up damage from different stress levels:
```
Total Damage = Œ£(actual cycles / allowable cycles)

Example:
Stress A: 1,000 cycles actual / 10,000 allowable = 0.1 damage
Stress B: 2,000 cycles actual / 100,000 allowable = 0.02 damage
Total = 0.12 damage (12% of life consumed)

When Total Damage = 1.0 ‚Üí Failure!
```

## Chapter 3: Real-World Factors

### Stress Concentration Factor (SCF)
Holes, welds, and geometry changes amplify stress:
```
Actual Stress = Nominal Stress √ó SCF

Think of it like this:
- Smooth bar: SCF = 1.0 (no amplification)
- Bar with hole: SCF = 3.0 (3x stress at hole edge!)
- Our critical location (loc02): SCF = 2.0
```

### Thickness Effect
Thicker plates are stronger against fatigue:
```
TCF = (thickness / 22mm)^0.25

Examples:
- 18mm plate: TCF = 0.95 (5% weaker)
- 50mm plate: TCF = 1.23 (23% stronger)
```

### Safety Factor
We design for 5x longer than needed:
```
Design Life = Required Life √ó Safety Factor
25 years required √ó 5 = 125 years design target
```

## Chapter 4: Running Your First Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the Files

**Input File Structure:**
```csv
stress range (Mpa),Cycles_Annual
10.0,5000000    # 5 million cycles at 10 MPa
20.0,2000000    # 2 million cycles at 20 MPa
30.0,500000     # 500k cycles at 30 MPa
```

**What each line means:**
- First column: Stress level
- Second column: How many times per year

### Step 2: Run the Analysis

```bash
# Navigate to the module
cd specs/modules/fatigue-analysis/stress_rainflow_to_damage

# Run test (quick check)
python run_damage_analysis.py --config input/damage_analysis_config_test.yml

# Check the output
ls output/test/damage_results/
```

### Step 3: Understand the Output

**Damage Rate File:**
```csv
stress_range_mpa,cycles_annual,stress_corrected_mpa,cycles_to_failure,damage_per_bin,damage_rate_per_year
10.0,5000000,11.5,1.45e10,3.44e-4,3.44e-4
```

**Reading this:**
- 10 MPa stress ‚Üí 11.5 MPa with SCF
- Can handle 14.5 billion cycles before failure
- 5 million cycles causes 0.000344 damage
- At this rate: 1/0.000344 = 2,907 years to failure!

## Chapter 5: Practical Exercise

### Exercise 1: Calculate Damage Manually

Given:
- Stress range: 40 MPa
- Annual cycles: 1,000,000
- SCF: 1.15
- No thickness correction

Steps:
1. Apply SCF: 40 √ó 1.15 = 46 MPa
2. Calculate N: log(N) = 12.164 - 3.0 √ó log(46)
   - log(46) = 1.663
   - log(N) = 12.164 - 3.0 √ó 1.663 = 7.175
   - N = 10^7.175 = 14,962,357 cycles
3. Damage = 1,000,000 / 14,962,357 = 0.0668
4. Life = 1 / 0.0668 = 15 years

### Exercise 2: Interpret Results

Look at this summary line:
```
loc02,25.0,2.0,1.032,14132800,0.0,inf,inf
```

Questions:
1. What's the thickness? ‚Üí 25mm
2. What's the SCF? ‚Üí 2.0 (highest!)
3. Why infinite life? ‚Üí Stress below 52.64 MPa limit
4. Should we worry? ‚Üí No, but monitor since highest SCF

## Chapter 6: Common Pitfalls

### 1. Unit Confusion
- Always use MPa for stress
- Cycles are counts (no units)
- Check input file headers!

### 2. Missing SCF
- Forgetting SCF underestimates damage
- Our loc02 has SCF=2.0 - doubles the stress!

### 3. Wrong S-N Curve
- Different curves for different conditions
- We use ABS E (in-air)
- Seawater would be more conservative

### 4. Ignoring Fatigue Limit
- Stress below 52.64 MPa = infinite life
- But corrosion can eliminate fatigue limit!

## Chapter 7: Python Code Walkthrough

### Core Calculation Function
```python
def calculate_damage(stress, cycles, scf, thickness):
    # Step 1: Apply SCF
    stress_actual = stress * scf
    
    # Step 2: Thickness correction
    tcf = (thickness / 22) ** 0.25
    stress_for_sn = stress_actual / tcf
    
    # Step 3: Check fatigue limit
    if stress_for_sn < 52.64:
        return 0  # Infinite life!
    
    # Step 4: Calculate cycles to failure
    log_n = 12.164 - 3.0 * math.log10(stress_for_sn)
    n_failure = 10 ** log_n
    
    # Step 5: Calculate damage
    damage = cycles / n_failure
    
    return damage
```
