## Technical Requirements

Implement a comprehensive web API integration module for data procurement that eliminates the need to download and store data files in the repository. This module will provide real-time access to marine engineering data through various web APIs including NOAA, Open-Meteo, StormGlass, and other industry-standard data providers.

## User Stories

### Marine Engineer Data Access

As a marine engineer, I want to retrieve real-time ocean and weather data through web APIs, so that I can perform analyses with the most current data without managing local file storage.

The engineer will configure API endpoints in YAML files, specify data parameters (wave height, wind speed, currents), and the system will automatically fetch, cache, and format the data for engineering calculations. The data will be seamlessly integrated into existing DigitalModel workflows without requiring manual downloads or file management.

### Offshore Project Manager API Management

As an offshore project manager, I want to manage multiple API subscriptions and keys through a centralized configuration, so that different projects can access appropriate data sources based on their requirements and budget constraints.

The manager will define API credentials in secure environment variables, set rate limits and quotas per project, and monitor API usage across different analyses. The system will automatically switch between free and premium APIs based on data requirements and availability.

### System Administrator Cost Control

As a system administrator, I want to monitor and control API usage costs, so that we stay within budget while maintaining data quality for critical analyses.

The administrator will set usage limits per API, receive alerts when approaching quotas, and view detailed usage reports. The system will implement intelligent caching to minimize redundant API calls and provide fallback options when primary APIs are unavailable.
