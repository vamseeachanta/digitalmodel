## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive tabular data on Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring (CALM) buoy systems installed worldwide. CALM buoys are offshore floating terminals that enable tankers to load and offload liquid products (primarily crude oil and refined petroleum) without requiring port infrastructure. Over 150 CALM systems operate globally, with installations spanning the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Africa, and the Americas.

**Key Statistics:**
- **Global Installations:** ~150 CALM systems + ~50 SALM systems worldwide
- **Operational Life:** 25-30+ years with proper maintenance
- **Typical Cost:** $15-20 million USD for large systems (new)
- **Major Suppliers:** SBM Offshore, SOFEC (FMC Technologies), Bluewater Energy Services
- **First Installation:** 1959 in Malaysia by Shell (48 ft water depth)

|--------------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Marine Breakaway Coupling (MBC)** | Emergency hose disconnect | Overpressure/overtension | <30 seconds |

| **Weather Monitoring** | Metocean data | Real-time sensors | Continuous |

**Emergency Scenarios & Responses:**

**1. Excessive Hawser Load:**
- Load pin monitoring triggers alarm
- Tanker adjusts position or increases thrust
- If load exceeds preset limit: Emergency disconnect

**2. Marine Breakaway Coupling Activation:**
- Automatic valve closure in both hose sections
- Hose sections separate at coupling
- Product release <5 liters typical
- Tanker can safely depart
- MBC must be reset/replaced before resuming operations

**3. Severe Weather Approach:**
- Weather monitoring provides advance warning
- Operations cease, tanker disconnects
- Hoses secured to buoy or laid on seabed
- Buoy unmanned, rides out storm
- Resume operations when conditions improve

**4. Anchor Chain Failure:**
- Remaining chains support buoy (redundancy)
- Position monitoring detects offset
- Operations cease immediately
- Emergency repair/replacement required
- System designed to withstand single chain failure

**5. Power System Failure:**
- Navigation lights have battery backup (7-14 days)
- Critical systems maintained on battery
- Solar system typically restores power within 24 hours
- Manual intervention if extended failure

## Conclusion & Key Findings

### Global Distribution Summary:
- **Total Installations:** ~200 systems worldwide (150 CALM + 50 SALM)
- **Regional Split:** Middle East 40%, Asia Pacific 30%, Africa 15%, Americas 15%
- **Growth Period:** Steady demand since early 1980s
- **Market Leaders:** SBM Offshore, SOFEC, Bluewater (75% combined market share)

### Technical Evolution:
1. **1st Generation (1959-1970s):** Wheel & Rail type - pioneering but high maintenance
2. **2nd Generation (1970s-1980s):** Turntable - successful but requires periodic dry-docking
3. **3rd Generation (1980-present):** Turret - current preferred design with 25+ year in-water life

### Key Advantages of CALM Buoys:
- **Economic:** Avoids port construction ($100M+ savings), eliminates dredging
- **Operational:** 360° weathervaning reduces downtime by 40-60%
- **Environmental:** Minimal seabed footprint, lower environmental impact
- **Flexibility:** Accommodates any tanker size (50K-520K DWT including VLCCs)
- **Speed:** Operational in 24-48 hours vs. years for port development
- **Accessibility:** Enables terminals in remote locations without infrastructure

### Lifecycle Performance:
- **Design Life:** 25-30+ years with proper maintenance
- **Availability:** >95% (typically 97-99%)
- **Turret Advantage:** 20-30% lower lifecycle cost vs. turntable design
- **Maintenance:** Monthly routine, annual surveys, major overhaul every 15-20 years

### Current Trends:
- Standardization (Fast4Ward programs)
- Deeper water applications (composite mooring legs)
- Multi-product capabilities (up to 4 simultaneous lines)
- Enhanced monitoring (real-time telemetry, digital twins)
- Energy transition support (hydrogen, CO2, ammonia transfer under development)

### Design Considerations Summary:
- **Water Depth:** Shallow (15-150m) uses chain; Deep (150-1500m) uses composite legs
- **Mooring:** 6-8 radial anchor legs in catenary configuration
- **Hoses:** Configuration (Chinese Lantern/Lazy-S/Steep-S) depends on depth
- **Vessel Connection:** Hawser system most common (nylon rope + chafe chain)
- **Product Transfer:** Multi-path swivel enables 1-4 independent fluid pathways
