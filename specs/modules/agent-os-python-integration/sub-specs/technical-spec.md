# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-python-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Python Package Standards**: Implement Agent OS patterns specific to poetry-managed Python packages with scientific dependencies
- **Engineering Domain Integration**: Extend existing code style to include mathematical notation, unit handling, and industry standard references
- **Testing Framework Enhancement**: Establish comprehensive testing patterns for engineering modules with mock integrations for licensed software
- **Documentation Standards**: Create structured documentation patterns for mathematical analysis modules and engineering workflows
- **Configuration Management**: Enhance YAML-driven configuration patterns specific to engineering analysis workflows

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Incremental Enhancement of Existing Structure
- Pros: Preserves existing work, minimal disruption to current workflows
- Cons: May not fully realize Agent OS potential, slower to implement comprehensive standards

**Option B:** Complete Agent OS Restructure (Selected)
- Pros: Full Agent OS integration, comprehensive development framework, future-proof structure
- Cons: More extensive changes required, longer implementation time

**Rationale:** Option B selected because the existing partial implementation provides a good foundation, and the engineering team will benefit from comprehensive development standards that Agent OS provides. The scientific computing nature of the project requires thorough documentation and testing frameworks that Agent OS excels at providing.

## External Dependencies

- **No new external libraries required** - This spec focuses on development framework enhancement
- **Agent OS Framework** - Uses existing Agent OS instructions and standards from user's global configuration
- **Justification:** Focus on leveraging existing Agent OS patterns rather than adding new dependencies to maintain package simplicity

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Product Documentation Enhancement
- Update existing product documentation in `.agent-os/product/` to reflect current state
- Add Python-specific and scientific computing patterns to architecture documentation
- Establish comprehensive mission statement reflecting engineering analysis focus

### Phase 2: Development Standards Integration
- Create or enhance Python-specific code style standards
- Establish testing patterns for engineering modules with licensed software dependencies
- Define mathematical computing and engineering analysis best practices

### Phase 3: Project Workflow Templates
- Create templates for common engineering analysis module development
- Establish patterns for YAML configuration-driven analysis workflows
- Define testing approaches for mathematical models and industry standard compliance

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing Framework
- Enhance documentation standards for mathematical analysis modules
- Implement comprehensive testing patterns with mock frameworks
- Establish code review and quality assurance processes specific to engineering analysis

## Engineering-Specific Considerations

### Industry Standards Compliance
- Maintain references to API, DNV, ABS, and other industry standards in code comments
- Ensure traceability between code implementation and engineering specifications
- Preserve domain expertise embedded in existing analysis modules

### Licensed Software Integration
- Establish patterns for graceful handling of OrcaFlex, ANSYS, and other licensed software
- Create comprehensive mock testing frameworks for licensed dependencies
- Maintain separation between commercial software interfaces and core analysis logic

### Mathematical Computing Patterns
- Define standards for unit handling and conversion
- Establish patterns for numerical analysis and scientific computing
- Create templates for mathematical model validation and benchmarking
