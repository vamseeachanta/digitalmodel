# Prompt Documentation

> Context: DigitalModel Repository

## Original Prompt

```
Create a comprehensive test automation system that can discover, execute, and maintain our entire test suite across all modules. The system should handle the current state where only 17.6% of tests are passing (30 out of 170 tests) and help us achieve 85% success rate with 90% code coverage.

Focus on:
1. Automatic test discovery and module-based execution
2. Failure analysis with pattern recognition
3. Automated fixes for common issues (import errors, file paths, config issues)
4. Comprehensive coverage tracking and reporting
5. Integration with CI/CD pipeline
```

## Prompt Analysis

### Intent
- Create an automated system to manage and improve the test suite
- Address the critical issue of low test success rate (17.6%)
- Implement coverage tracking to reach 90% code coverage target
- Provide automated remediation for common test failures

### Key Requirements Identified
1. **Test Discovery**: Automatic identification of all test modules
2. **Module-Based Execution**: Organize and run tests by engineering domain
3. **Failure Analysis**: Pattern recognition and automated fixes
4. **Coverage Tracking**: Multi-dimensional coverage metrics and reporting
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Pipeline integration with quality gates

## Context and Motivation

### Current State Analysis
- **Success Rate**: 17.6% (30/170 tests passing)
- **Code Coverage**: Estimated 42.3% (needs improvement)
- **Main Issues**:
  - OrcaFlex license dependencies
  - Import errors and missing modules
  - Configuration file issues
  - File path problems

### Strategic Goals
- **Phase 1 (30 days)**: Achieve 40% success rate, 60% coverage
- **Phase 2 (90 days)**: Achieve 70% success rate, 80% coverage
- **Phase 3 (120 days)**: Achieve 85% success rate, 90% coverage

## Implementation Approach

### Technical Strategy
1. **Module-Based Architecture**: Organize tests by engineering domain (AQWA, OrcaFlex, pipeline, etc.)
2. **Pattern-Based Fixes**: Apply successful patterns from working modules
3. **Mock Framework**: Comprehensive mocking for licensed software
4. **Coverage Integration**: pytest-cov with multiple report formats

### Phased Execution
1. **Foundation**: Core test runner with discovery engine
2. **Remediation**: Fix high-impact modules (AQWA, pipeline, fatigue)
3. **Coverage**: Implement comprehensive tracking and reporting
4. **Automation**: Auto-fix engine with confidence scoring
5. **Excellence**: AI-powered test generation and optimization

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- Test success rate: 17.6% → 85%
- Code coverage: 42.3% → 90%
- Auto-fix rate: 80% of identified patterns
- Module health: 10+ modules with >90% pass rate

### Qualitative Goals
- Self-healing test infrastructure
- Comprehensive mock frameworks for all licensed software
- Executive dashboard with real-time metrics
- Automated quality gates in CI/CD

## Lessons Learned

### From Implementation
- Mock patterns from time_series module proven effective
- YAML fixture libraries essential for hydrodynamic tests
- Coverage tracking must include branch and integration coverage
- Manual review field critical for unfixable issues

### Best Practices Identified
- TDD approach with tests written first
- Module-based organization improves maintainability
- Parallel execution reduces runtime significantly
- Coverage-aware fix prioritization maximizes impact

## Curated Reuse Prompt

For future enhancements or similar test automation systems:

```
Enhance the test suite automation system with the following capabilities:

Current State:
- Module-based test discovery and execution implemented
- Coverage tracking integrated with pytest-cov
- Basic failure analysis with pattern recognition
- Mock frameworks for OrcaFlex and ANSYS

New Requirements:
[Specify new features needed, e.g.:]
- Add mutation testing capabilities
- Implement test flakiness detection
- Create visual regression testing
- Add performance benchmark tracking
- Integrate with additional CI/CD platforms

Constraints:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test structure
- Preserve module-based organization
- Keep execution time under 10 minutes for full suite
- Ensure mock frameworks remain engineering-accurate

Expected Outcome:
[Define specific success metrics and deliverables]
```
