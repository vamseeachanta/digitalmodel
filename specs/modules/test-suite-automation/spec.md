# Test Suite Automation and Maintenance

> Spec: Automated Test Suite Management
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: Active
> Version: 1.0.0

## Overview

The test suite automation system provides continuous monitoring, execution, and maintenance of the repository's comprehensive test suite. This system ensures all tests remain current, properly categorized, and executable while providing detailed reporting and automated failure resolution.

## Command Syntax

```
/test-automation [command] [options]
```

### Commands
- `run-all`: Execute all tests by module
- `run-module <module_name>`: Execute tests for specific module
- `status`: Show test suite status summary
- `fix-failing`: Attempt automated fixes for failing tests
- `report`: Generate comprehensive test report
- `clean`: Clean up test artifacts and temporary files

### Options
- `--parallel`: Run tests in parallel (default: true)
- `--verbose`: Show detailed test output
- `--coverage`: Generate comprehensive coverage reports with metrics
- `--coverage-threshold <percentage>`: Set minimum coverage threshold (default: 80%)
- `--coverage-report-format {html,json,lcov,xml}`: Coverage report format
- `--fix-auto`: Automatically fix resolvable issues
- `--mark-manual`: Mark unfixable tests for manual review

## User Stories

### Developer Running Complete Test Suite

As a developer, I want to run all tests across modules and get a comprehensive summary of results, so I can understand the current state of the codebase.

**Workflow:**
1. Execute test automation system
2. System discovers all test modules automatically
3. Tests run in parallel by module
4. Results aggregated with pass/fail summary
5. Failing tests automatically analyzed for fixability
6. Report generated with actionable insights

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

As a CI/CD system, I want automated test execution with failure handling, so that the pipeline can proceed or fail with clear actionable information.

**Workflow:**
1. Pipeline triggers test automation
2. System runs all tests by module
3. Failing tests analyzed and categorized
4. Fixable tests automatically resolved
5. Unfixable tests marked for manual review
6. Pipeline receives clear pass/fail status with detailed reporting

## Test Coverage Framework

### Coverage Metrics and Tracking

The test automation system provides comprehensive coverage analysis across multiple dimensions:

#### 1. **Code Coverage Analysis**
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of source code lines executed during tests
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches tested
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called during test execution
- **Module Coverage**: Coverage analysis per module and package

#### 2. **Test Suite Coverage Metrics**
- **Feature Coverage**: Percentage of documented features with automated tests
- **Module Coverage**: Percentage of source modules with associated test files
- **API Coverage**: Percentage of public APIs with test cases
- **Integration Coverage**: Coverage of inter-module dependencies and workflows

#### 3. **Domain-Specific Coverage**
- **Engineering Standards Coverage**: Tests covering API, DNV, ABS compliance requirements
- **Licensed Software Coverage**: Mock test coverage for OrcaFlex, ANSYS workflows
- **Configuration Coverage**: Test coverage for YAML configuration files and parameters
- **Input/Output Coverage**: Coverage of different input scenarios and output formats

  - Legacy code coverage should improve over time

### Coverage-Driven Development Integration

#### Pre-commit Coverage Checks
```bash
# Automated coverage validation before commits
test-automation run-module <changed_module> --coverage --coverage-threshold 85
```

#### CI/CD Coverage Gates
- **Pull Request Validation**: Coverage analysis on changed files
- **Release Gates**: Overall coverage threshold enforcement
- **Coverage Reporting**: Automated coverage reports in PR comments

#### Developer Workflow Integration
```bash
# Coverage-focused development workflow
test-automation run-all --coverage --verbose
