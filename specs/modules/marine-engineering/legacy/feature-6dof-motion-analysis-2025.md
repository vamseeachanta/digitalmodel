## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Approach
Implement modular 6-DOF motion analysis system with clear separation between data processing, analysis algorithms, and result generation:

```python
# 6-DOF Motion Analysis Framework
class SixDOFMotionAnalysis:
    def __init__(self, vessel_config: VesselConfiguration):
        self.vessel = vessel_config
        self.rao_processor = RAODataProcessor()
        self.motion_calculator = MotionCalculator()
        self.statistical_analyzer = StatisticalAnalyzer()
        self.criteria_assessor = MotionCriteriaAssessor()
    
    def run_motion_analysis(self, environmental_conditions: EnvironmentalConditions) -> MotionResults:
        """Complete 6-DOF motion analysis workflow."""
        # Import and process RAO data
        # Calculate motions in frequency/time domain
        # Perform statistical analysis
        # Assess motion criteria
        return comprehensive_results
```

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Decision**: Support multiple RAO data formats (AQWA, experimental, generic)
   - **Rationale**: Industry uses various data sources and formats
   - **Alternatives**: Single format support, manual conversion required
   - **Impact**: Increased flexibility and user adoption

2. **Decision**: Implement both frequency and time domain analysis
   - **Rationale**: Different applications require different analysis approaches
   - **Alternatives**: Frequency domain only, time domain only
   - **Impact**: Comprehensive analysis capabilities for all use cases

3. **Decision**: Modular statistical analysis with customizable criteria
   - **Rationale**: Different projects have different motion criteria requirements
   - **Alternatives**: Fixed criteria, manual post-processing
   - **Impact**: Flexible system adaptable to various project requirements
