# Executive Summary: Passing Ship Forces Calculation Module

> **Project**: MathCAD to Python Conversion - Ship Interaction Forces
> **Date**: 2025-01-01
> **Status**: Planning Phase
> **Estimated Delivery**: 4-5 days
> **Business Value**: High

## Executive Overview

This project converts a critical MathCAD-based calculation tool for assessing ship-to-ship interaction forces into a modern, scalable Python module. The solution directly addresses operational safety requirements in marine operations while eliminating dependency on legacy software and expensive consulting fees.

## Business Case

### Problem Statement
Marine operations currently rely on:
- Legacy MathCAD calculations requiring licensed software ($2,000/seat/year)
- External consultants for passing vessel assessments ($5,000/analysis)
- Manual, error-prone calculation processes taking 2+ hours per scenario
- Limited batch processing capabilities for parametric studies

### Solution Benefits

#### Immediate Returns
- **Cost Reduction**: Save $60,000/year in consultant fees (12 analyses/year)
- **Time Savings**: Reduce analysis time by 95% (2 hours → 5 minutes)
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Automated validation ensures 0.1% accuracy
- **Scalability**: Process 1000+ scenarios in parallel

#### Strategic Value
- **Standardization**: Consistent methodology across all projects
- **Integration**: Direct connection to OrcaFlex/AQWA analysis tools
- **Compliance**: Meet OCIMF and API RP 2SK requirements automatically
- **Knowledge Retention**: Institutionalize expertise in reusable code
