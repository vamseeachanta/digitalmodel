## Overview

Advanced quasi-static catenary solver for mooring line analysis implementing analytical catenary equations with numerical iteration for boundary value problems. Converts Excel array formula implementation to vectorized Python with multi-segment support and elastic elongation.

### Purpose
Calculate mooring line shape, tension distribution, and restoring forces for suspended cables under self-weight and pretension, supporting both infinite and finite water depth scenarios.

### Scope
- Single-segment uniform catenary analysis
- Multi-segment composite mooring lines
- Elastic elongation integration
- Touchdown point calculations
- Stiffness matrix for coupled dynamics

---

## Mathematical Foundation

### Classical Catenary Equation

For a uniform cable suspended between two points under its own weight:

**Catenary Shape:**
```
y(x) = a * cosh(x/a) - a
```

Where:
- `a = H / w` (catenary parameter)
- `H` = horizontal tension component [N]
- `w` = submerged weight per unit length [N/m]
- `x` = horizontal distance from low point [m]
- `y` = vertical distance from low point [m]

**Arc Length:**
```
s(x) = a * sinh(x/a)
```

**Tension at Point:**
```
T(x) = w * sqrt(aÂ² + y(x)Â²) = sqrt(HÂ² + (w*y)Â²)
```

### Boundary Value Problem

Given:
- Total line length `L` (unstretched)
- Horizontal span `X_span`
- Vertical span `Y_span` (fairlead depth - anchor depth)
- Weight per length `w`
- Axial stiffness `EA`

Find: Horizontal tension `H` such that:
```
s(X_span) + elongation(H) = L
```

Where:
```
elongation = H * L / EA
```

### Excel Implementation (Extracted)

The Excel "Poly Mooring" sheet uses array formulas with iterative solvers:

```excel
// Catenary parameter
a = H / w

// Arc length at horizontal span
s = a * SINH(X_span / a)

// Elastic elongation
e = H * L / EA

// Length error for iteration
error = s + e - L

// Solver: Goal Seek or VBA iteration to minimize error
```

**Excel Convergence:** Uses Excel Solver or Goal Seek with tolerance 1e-6

## Multi-Segment Catenary Analysis

### Composite Mooring Line

Realistic mooring lines consist of multiple segments with different properties:
- Chain at fairlead
- Wire rope midspan
- Chain at anchor

### Multi-Segment Algorithm

```python
@dataclass
class LineSegment:
    """Individual segment of composite mooring line."""
    length: float               # Unstretched length [m]
    weight_per_length: float    # Submerged weight [N/m]
    ea_stiffness: float        # Axial stiffness [N]
    segment_type: str          # "chain", "wire", "synthetic"

class MultiSegmentCatenary:
    """Solver for composite multi-segment mooring lines."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.single_solver = CatenarySolver()

    def solve_composite_line(
        self,
        segments: list[LineSegment],
        horizontal_span: float,
        vertical_span: float
    ) -> dict:
        """
        Solve composite mooring line with multiple segments.

        Approach:
        1. Assume horizontal tension H (constant along line)
        2. Solve each segment's catenary with known H
        3. Sum total horizontal and vertical spans
        4. Iterate H until spans match boundary conditions

        This is more complex than single segment and requires
        iterative solution of system of equations.
        """

        def span_error(H: float) -> Tuple[float, float]:
            """Calculate error in horizontal and vertical spans."""
            total_x = 0.0
            total_y = 0.0

            for segment in segments:
                # Solve individual segment catenary
                # This gets complex - see detailed implementation
                pass

            x_error = total_x - horizontal_span
            y_error = total_y - vertical_span

            return x_error, y_error

        # Use 2D Newton-Raphson or least squares optimization
        # to find H that satisfies both span constraints
        pass
```

**Note:** Multi-segment implementation is complex and planned for Phase 2.

## Validation Against Excel

### Test Cases from Excel

Excel "Poly Mooring" sheet provides reference cases:

**Test Case 1: Single Chain Segment**
```yaml
input:
  length: 1000          # m
  horizontal_span: 800  # m
  vertical_span: 100    # m (fairlead depth)
  weight_per_length: 1962  # N/m (76mm chain in water)
  ea_stiffness: 64e9    # N (studlink chain)

expected_excel_results:
  horizontal_tension: 785_000  # N (Â±1%)
  vertical_tension: 196_200    # N
  total_tension: 809_000       # N
  elongation: 12.3             # m
```

**Validation Criteria:**
```python
def test_against_excel_case_1():
    """Validate Python solver against Excel reference."""
    params = CatenaryInput(
        length=1000,
        horizontal_span=800,
        vertical_span=100,
        weight_per_length=1962,
        ea_stiffness=64e9
    )

    solver = CatenarySolver()
    results = solver.solve(params)

    # Excel reference values
    assert abs(results.horizontal_tension - 785_000) / 785_000 < 0.01
    assert abs(results.vertical_tension_fairlead - 196_200) / 196_200 < 0.01
    assert results.converged == True
```

---

## Performance Requirements

- **Single Segment**: <10ms solution time
- **Convergence**: <10 iterations typical
- **Accuracy**: Within 0.1% of Excel results
- **Robustness**: Handle extreme geometries (shallow/steep lines)

---

## Integration Points

### Ship Dynamics Module
- Provides mooring restoring forces vs vessel offset
- Linearized stiffness matrix for coupled analysis

### OrcaFlex Export
- Line shape initial conditions
- Pretension values for dynamic analysis

### Component Database
- Load segment properties (weight, EA) by specification

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Catenary**: Time-varying tension analysis
- **Seabed Interaction**: Friction and embedment models
- **Current Effects**: Hydrodynamic drag on suspended line
- **3D Catenary**: Out-of-plane effects for spread moorings
