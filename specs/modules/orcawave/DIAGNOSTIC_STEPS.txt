1. CHECK ORCAWAVE VERSION
   - Open OrcaWave
   - Help -> About
   - Verify version is 11.5 or compatible

2. CHECK MESH FILE
   - File -> Open
   - Navigate to: D:\github\digitalmodel\specs\modules\orcawave\diffraction-analysis\inputs\geometry\
   - Try opening: simple_box_test.gdf directly
   - If it opens, the mesh file is valid

   - Try to run

4. CHECK ERROR LOG
