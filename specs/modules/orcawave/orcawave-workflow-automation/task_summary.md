## Approach Documentation

### Implementation Strategy
- **Repository Pattern Compliance**: Created specification in mandatory `specs/modules/orcawave/` structure
- **Agent Integration**: Leveraged existing GMsh and OrcaWave agent capabilities
- **Parallel Processing**: Designed workflow with mandatory parallel execution requirements
- **UV Environment Integration**: All tasks specified to use repository UV environment
- **Escalation Protocol**: Included specialized knowledge escalation triggers

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Hybrid AI/User Execution**: AI generates and validates scripts, user executes licensed software
2. **Agent Delegation Matrix**: Formal assignment of tasks to specialized agents
3. **Quality-First Approach**: Parallel validation before any production execution
4. **Mathematical Rigor**: Included proper hydrodynamic formulations and mesh quality equations
5. **Integration Focus**: Designed for seamless OrcaFlex pipeline integration

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Creation Time**: ~45 minutes for complete specification suite
- **Parallel Processing**: Used concurrent clarification and documentation creation
- **Reusability**: Created curated prompt template for future workflow specifications
- **Completeness**: 100% coverage of required specification components

## Next Logical Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 Days)
1. **User Review and Approval**: Stakeholder review of executive summary and technical approach
2. **Agent Capability Validation**: Verify GMsh and OrcaWave agents meet workflow requirements
3. **Environment Preparation**: Ensure UV environment has all required dependencies
4. **Test Data Preparation**: Validate Sea Cypress geometry files are accessible and correct

### Short-term Implementation (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. **Phase 1 Execution**: Begin core infrastructure setup and agent communication framework
2. **Mesh Processing Pipeline**: Implement GMsh integration and quality validation system
3. **Parallel Testing Framework**: Create validation system for configuration testing
4. **User Coordination**: Establish procedures for licensed OrcaWave execution

### Medium-term Development (Next 1-2 Months)
1. **Complete Pipeline Integration**: Full workflow from mesh to OrcaFlex results
2. **Batch Processing Implementation**: Multi-geometry parallel analysis capability
3. **Production Validation**: Sea Cypress benchmark validation and accuracy verification
4. **Documentation and Training**: User guides and troubleshooting procedures
