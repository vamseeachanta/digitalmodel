SEA CYPRESS ORCAWAVE CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS
============================================================

Configuration File: sea_cypress_diffraction.yml
Panel Count: 24,332
Vessel Type: Tug (Sea Cypress)

ISSUES:
- HIGH panel count (24,332) - may cause memory/performance issues
- High aspect ratio tolerance (25) - may affect accuracy
- Large waterline gap tolerance (0.1m)
- Missing high-frequency response (shortest period is 3s)
- Limited low-frequency coverage (longest period is 25s)
- Direct LU solver with large mesh may be slow
- Full QTF calculation is computationally expensive
- Mass appears to be estimated (400 tonnes)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using symmetry to reduce panel count by 50%
- Reduce PanelAspectRatioWarningLevel to 15-20
- Reduce WaterlineGapTolerance to 0.01-0.05m for better waterline definition
- Extend period range down to 2s for complete high-frequency coverage
- Consider extending to 30s for slow-drift analysis
- Consider using port/starboard symmetry if vessel is symmetric
- Consider iterative solver for large meshes
- Consider 'Diagonal QTF only' for initial runs
- Update with actual vessel mass for accurate RAOs
