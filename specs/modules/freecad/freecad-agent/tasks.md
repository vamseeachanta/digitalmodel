## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path Items
1. FreeCAD API Wrapper (blocks all CAD operations)
2. Parallel Processing Engine (blocks batch processing)
3. Module Integration (blocks ecosystem connectivity)

### Contingency Plans
- **API Limitations**: Implement workarounds or request FreeCAD enhancements
- **Performance Issues**: Scale back features or optimize algorithms
- **Integration Challenges**: Develop adapter patterns or middleware
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize core features, defer advanced capabilities

## Notes

- Tasks can be executed in parallel where dependencies allow
- Each task includes time for testing and documentation
- Regular check-ins with stakeholders recommended
- Continuous integration should be set up early
- User feedback should be incorporated throughout development
