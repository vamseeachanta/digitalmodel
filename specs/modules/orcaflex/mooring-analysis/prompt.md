  - Test examples in `tests/modules/orcaflex/mooring-tension-iteration/fsts-l015-test-cases/`
- Follow repository patterns and ensure the spec is production-ready, not test-focused.

## Analysis Approach

### Codebase Investigation
I conducted comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase to understand:

1. **Existing Mooring Analysis Capabilities**:
   - Analyzed `src/digitalmodel/modules/orcaflex/mooring.py` (830 lines) with comprehensive pretension analysis
   - Found existing 3D stiffness matrix calculation implementation
   - Identified parallel processing patterns with ThreadPoolExecutor (30 workers)
   - Discovered existing visualization integration with MooringVisualization class
   - Found fender force analysis capabilities

2. **Comparative Analysis Module**:
   - Examined `src/digitalmodel/modules/orcaflex/analysis/comparative.py` (534 lines)
   - Identified multi-configuration analysis patterns
   - Found visualization and reporting capabilities
   - Discovered statistical analysis and line group classification

3. **Repository Patterns**:
   - Confirmed module-based organization: `specs/modules/<module>/`
   - Identified CLI consistency requirements and parameter standards
   - Found UV environment usage requirements
   - Discovered OrcaFlex agent integration patterns

4. **Test Data & Examples**:
   - Analyzed test examples in `tests/modules/orcaflex/mooring-tension-iteration/fsts-l015-test-cases/`
   - Found comprehensive configuration examples and output data
   - Identified visualization and reporting patterns

### Clarification Questions Developed
Before creating the specification, I developed clarification questions to ensure optimal solution design:

1. **Scope & Integration**: Integration approach with existing modules
2. **Requirements & Quality**: Natural period ranges and stiffness matrix requirements  
3. **Timeline & Success Criteria**: Static vs dynamic analysis support
4. **Performance & Scalability**: Typical mooring line counts and parallel processing needs
5. **Configuration Management**: YAML pattern usage and backward compatibility

### Solution Architecture Selection
I evaluated three approaches:
1. **Enhancement Approach**: Extend existing `mooring.py`
2. **Modular Approach**: Create new standalone module with integration
3. **Refactor Approach**: Restructure existing analysis engine

**Selected: Modular Approach** based on optimization criteria:
- Performance (30%): Clean separation enabling parallel processing optimization
- Simplicity (30%): Clear module boundaries without disrupting existing workflows  
- Maintainability (20%): Independent testing and development cycles
- Scalability (20%): Easy extension for future analysis types
