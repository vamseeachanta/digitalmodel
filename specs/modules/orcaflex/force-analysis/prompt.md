# OrcaFlex Force Analysis - Development Prompts

> **Module**: `orcaflex/force-analysis`  
> **Type**: Prompt History and Reuse Patterns  
> **Updated**: 2025-08-12  

## Original Problem Statement

### Initial User Challenge (2025-07-01)
```
"We have thousands of OrcaFlex CSV files from marine structure simulations, and finding the maximum strut forces manually takes hours. Engineers are spending entire mornings hunting through files to find worst-case scenarios. We need an automated way to identify the critical loading conditions instantly."
```

### Follow-up Requirements
```
"The system needs to:
- Process 1000+ CSV files quickly 
- Find the absolute maximum strut forces across all simulations
- Identify which specific simulation produced the maximum
- Load the corresponding time series data automatically
- Handle different file naming patterns and folder structures"
```

## The Breakthrough Discovery

### Investigation Prompt (2025-07-03)
```
"I'm analyzing OrcaFlex CSV output structure. I see there are summary files with pattern 'dm*strut_dyn.csv' that seem to contain max/min values, and separate time series files. Can you help me understand the relationship between these file types and whether we can avoid scanning time series data for maximum values?"
```

### Critical Discovery Prompt (2025-07-05) - ⭐ GAME CHANGER
```
"I found something interesting in the dm*strut_dyn.csv files. There's a column called 'fe_filename' that appears to contain the exact simulation basename. Each row represents a different simulation run, and this column tells us which .sim file produced that row's data. Can we use this to:

1. Find the row with maximum force values
2. Extract the fe_filename from that row  
3. Use that basename to find all related time series files
4. Completely skip scanning time series data for maximums

This could be a massive performance improvement if it works."
```

**This prompt led to the 1000x performance breakthrough.**

### Validation Prompt (2025-07-06)
```
"Let's validate this fe_filename approach:

1. Test with a large dataset (500+ files)
2. Compare results with time series scanning method
3. Measure performance difference 
4. Verify 100% accuracy of file associations
5. Document the performance improvement

If this works as expected, we've just solved the core performance problem."
```

## Algorithm Development Prompts

### Core Algorithm Design (2025-07-07)
```
"Design a parallel processing algorithm that:

1. Scans for dm*strut_dyn.csv files in the target folder
2. Processes each file to find the row with maximum absolute force
3. Extracts fe_filename from that maximum force row
4. Parses the simulation basename from fe_filename
5. Extracts configuration parameters from the basename pattern
6. Returns a complete configuration object for UI population

Requirements:
- Use ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound parallel processing
- Handle up to 20 worker processes optimally
- Provide progress tracking and error handling
- Return structured results for API consumption
```

### Configuration Extraction (2025-07-08)
```
"From the fe_filename basename like 'fsts_l015_hwl_ncl_000deg_Jacket1', extract:

- Vessel type (fsts/lngc)
- Loading percentages (l015 = 15% LNG)
- Tide level (hwl/mwl/lwl)  
- Environment type (ncl = non-colinear, cl = colinear)
- Heading angle (000deg = 0 degrees)
- Component type (Jacket1, Strut1, etc.)

Create a robust parser that handles variations and provides fallbacks for non-standard patterns."
```

### Pattern Matching for Parameter Override (2025-07-09)
```
"When users change parameters in the UI, modify the sim_basename accordingly:

- Heading change: 000deg -> 045deg
- Tide change: hwl -> mwl
- Loading change: l015 -> l095
- Environment change: ncl -> cl

Then search for all files matching the modified basename pattern. This enables real-time parameter override without re-scanning all summary files."
```

## Performance Optimization Prompts

### Parallel Processing Optimization (2025-07-10)
```
"Optimize the parallel processing for maximum performance:

1. Determine optimal worker count based on CPU cores and file count
2. Minimize memory usage by processing one file at a time per worker
3. Use efficient data structures to minimize memory allocations
4. Implement intelligent batching for very large file sets
5. Add progress reporting without impacting performance

Target: Process 1000+ files in under 20 seconds."
```

### Memory Management (2025-07-11)
```
"The system needs to handle very large datasets efficiently. Implement:

1. Streaming CSV processing to avoid loading entire files into memory
2. Garbage collection after each file processing
3. Memory monitoring and alerting for large operations
4. Intelligent caching for frequently accessed configurations
5. Memory usage reporting and optimization recommendations

Keep total memory usage under 1GB even for 2000+ file datasets."
```

### Caching Strategy (2025-07-12)
```
"Implement intelligent caching to improve performance for repeated operations:

1. Cache summary file processing results indexed by file path and modification time
2. Cache configuration extraction results to avoid re-parsing basenames
3. Implement cache invalidation when files are modified
4. Add cache hit/miss ratio monitoring for optimization
5. Provide cache management tools for administrators

Balance memory usage vs performance improvement."
```

## Integration and API Design Prompts

### Results Dashboard Integration (2025-07-15)
```
"Create API endpoints for Results Dashboard integration:

POST /api/max_strut_force
- Accept folder path parameter
- Return complete maximum force configuration
- Include processing metrics and file counts
- Provide structured data for UI auto-population
- Handle errors gracefully with detailed messages

The response should enable the dashboard to:
1. Display maximum force information
2. Auto-populate all UI controls with worst-case parameters  
3. Show processing performance metrics
4. Load related time series data automatically"
```

### Browser Interface Support (2025-07-16)
```
"Add support for manual parameter override workflow:

POST /api/files_for_configuration  
- Accept base configuration and parameter changes
- Modify sim_basename pattern based on changes
- Search for files matching modified pattern
- Return categorized file lists (Jacket, Strut, Mooring, Motion)
- Provide instant response for real-time UI updates

This enables users to change any parameter and immediately see related files."
```

### Error Handling and Robustness (2025-07-17)
```
"Make the system production-ready with comprehensive error handling:

1. File access errors (permissions, missing files, corruption)
2. Data quality issues (empty files, missing columns, invalid data)
3. Processing errors (memory exhaustion, timeout, worker failures)
4. Configuration errors (invalid parameters, unsupported patterns)
5. System errors (disk space, network issues, resource limits)

Each error should:
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Log detailed information for debugging
- Attempt graceful recovery when possible
- Never crash the entire system
```
