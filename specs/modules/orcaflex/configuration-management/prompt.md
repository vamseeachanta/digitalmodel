# Configuration Management - Development Prompts

> **Module**: `configuration-management`  
> **Created**: 2025-08-12  
> **Purpose**: Document consolidation process and reusable patterns  

## Original Consolidation Request

**User Request**:
```
Consolidate all OrcaFlex specifications from two locations into one unified structure following repository best practices:

Sources to consolidate:
1. specs\modules\marine-engineering\orcaflex\
2. specs\modules\orcaflex\

Target location: specs\modules\orcaflex\ (the dedicated module location)

Steps to follow:
1. First, analyze what's in both locations to understand overlap and unique content
2. Determine the best organization structure for consolidated specs
3. Move marine-engineering\orcaflex content to the main orcaflex module
4. Ensure no duplicate content - merge where needed
5. Create proper sub-module organization following best practices:
   - Each major area should have: README.md, tasks.md, task_summary.md, prompt.md, technical-details.md
   - Use sub-specs/ folders for component specifications
6. Update all cross-references to point to new consolidated location
7. Create a comprehensive README at specs\modules\orcaflex\README.md explaining the consolidated structure
8. Remove the now-empty marine-engineering\orcaflex folder
9. Update marine-engineering\README.md to reference the consolidated location

Focus on:
- Preserving all technical content
- Creating logical groupings (dashboard, analysis, integration, etc.)
- Following repository's mandatory module-based organization
- Ensuring clear navigation and documentation
- Maintaining production system documentation intact

The goal is to have ONE authoritative location for all OrcaFlex specifications that is well-organized and follows best practices.
```

## Analysis & Strategy Development

### Content Analysis Approach
```
1. Systematic directory listing of both source locations
2. Content analysis through parallel file reading
3. Overlap identification and unique content mapping
4. Integration strategy development
```

### Key Findings Documentation
```markdown
**Source 1: specs/modules/marine-engineering/orcaflex/**
- 3 focused operational files
- Sequential processing configuration  
- Troubleshooting procedures ("NoneType" errors)
- Production workflow management

**Source 2: specs/modules/orcaflex/**  
- 4 major production system modules
- Comprehensive sub-specs structure
- Repository pattern compliance
- Complete documentation sets

**Critical Insight**: No content overlap - complementary operational vs system focus
```

### Consolidation Strategy
```
Decision: Create "configuration-management" sub-module
Rationale: Preserves all content while creating logical operational focus
Structure: specs/modules/orcaflex/configuration-management/
```

## Implementation Pattern

### Directory Structure Creation
```bash
# Parallel directory creation pattern
mkdir -p "D:\github\digitalmodel\specs\modules\orcaflex\configuration-management\sub-specs\sequential-processing" "D:\github\digitalmodel\specs\modules\orcaflex\configuration-management\sub-specs\troubleshooting" "D:\github\digitalmodel\specs\modules\orcaflex\configuration-management\sub-specs\workflow-management"
```

### Documentation Template Applied
```markdown
# Module README Pattern:
> **Module**: `configuration-management`  
> **Parent**: `specs/modules/orcaflex/`  
> **Domain**: OrcaFlex Post-Processing & Workflow Management  
> **Status**: Production Operations  
> **Updated**: 2025-08-12  

## Overview
[Business impact and technical scope]

## Module Specifications  
[Sub-module documentation with status indicators]

## System Architecture
[Mermaid diagrams showing integration]

## Performance Impact
[Metrics and business value]
```

## Reusable Consolidation Pattern

### Step 1: Analysis Pattern
```
1. Use parallel LS tool calls for directory structure analysis
2. Use parallel Read tool calls for content analysis  
3. Identify overlap vs complementary content
4. Determine optimal organization strategy
```

### Step 2: Structure Creation Pattern
```
1. Create logical sub-module groupings
2. Apply repository pattern requirements:
   - README.md (comprehensive overview)
   - tasks.md (implementation roadmap)
   - task_summary.md (progress tracking)  
   - prompt.md (development documentation)
   - technical-details.md (implementation specs)
3. Use sub-specs/ for component organization
```

### Step 3: Content Migration Pattern
```
1. Preserve ALL original content exactly
2. Enhance with repository pattern compliance
3. Add integration documentation
4. Create comprehensive cross-references
5. Update all affected modules
```

### Step 4: Integration Pattern
```
1. Update parent module README
2. Add system architecture integration
3. Document cross-module relationships  
4. Validate all references and links
5. Clean up legacy locations
```

4. **Integration Focus**: Consider how consolidated content fits broader ecosystem

### Repository Pattern Application
1. **Mandatory Compliance**: Pattern is non-negotiable across all modules
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All pattern files must add real value
3. **Cross-Module Integration**: Consider broader system architecture impact
