## Executive Summary

The OrcaFlex Mooring Tension Iteration System automates the critical process of adjusting mooring line lengths to achieve target tension values in offshore floating structure analysis. This system addresses the time-intensive manual process currently requiring multiple OrcaFlex runs and manual adjustments, replacing it with a single-iteration Python-based automation solution.

**Business Value**: Reduces mooring design iteration time from hours to minutes, enabling rapid design optimization and reducing engineering costs by 80% while ensuring consistent, accurate target tension achievement.

**Target Users**: Offshore engineers, mooring system designers, and marine analysts working with OrcaFlex models requiring precise mooring tension control.

## Overview

The system provides automated iteration capabilities for adjusting mooring line properties to achieve specified tension targets in OrcaFlex models. The core functionality processes:

- **Multi-Line Iteration**: Simultaneous adjustment of multiple mooring lines (Line1, Line2, etc.) using Newton-Raphson method: $x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$
- **Target Tension Matching**: Precise convergence to user-defined tension values $T_{target}$ with tolerance $\epsilon = \pm 1\%$
- **Stiffness-Based Length Adjustment**: Intelligent line length modification using mooring line stiffness characteristics: $\Delta L = \frac{\Delta T}{k_{eff}}$
- **Single Iteration Convergence**: Optimization algorithm achieving target tensions in one iteration cycle, eliminating manual trial-and-error

## User Stories

### Secondary User: Project Lead
- **Story 4**: As a project lead, I want automated tension reports with before/after comparisons so I can track design optimization progress.

## Mathematical Framework

### Tension Equilibrium System
The system solves the non-linear equation set:
$$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{L}) = \mathbf{T}(\mathbf{L}) - \mathbf{T}_{target} = \mathbf{0}$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{L} = [L_1, L_2, ..., L_n]^T$ is the vector of line lengths
- $\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{L}) = [T_1(\mathbf{L}), T_2(\mathbf{L}), ..., T_n(\mathbf{L})]^T$ is the tension response vector
- $\mathbf{T}_{target} = [T_{target,1}, T_{target,2}, ..., T_{target,n}]^T$ is the target tension vector

### Newton-Raphson Iteration
The iterative solution follows:
$$\mathbf{L}^{(k+1)} = \mathbf{L}^{(k)} - \mathbf{J}^{-1}(\mathbf{L}^{(k)}) \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{L}^{(k)})$$

Where the Jacobian matrix is:
$$J_{ij} = \frac{\partial T_i}{\partial L_j} \approx \frac{T_i(\mathbf{L} + h\mathbf{e}_j) - T_i(\mathbf{L})}{h}$$

### Stiffness Approximation
For initial estimates, the effective line stiffness is:
$$k_{eff,i} = \frac{EA}{L_{initial,i}} \cos^2(\theta_{line,i})$$

Where:
- $EA$ is the line axial stiffness
- $\theta_{line,i}$ is the line angle from horizontal
- $L_{initial,i}$ is the initial line length
