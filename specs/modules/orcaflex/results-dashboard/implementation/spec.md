## Executive Summary

The OrcaFlex Results Visualization Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based platform for analyzing and visualizing offshore engineering simulation results. This dashboard addresses the critical need for marine engineers to efficiently explore, analyze, and present complex hydrodynamic and structural response data from OrcaFlex simulations.

**Business Value**: Reduces analysis time by 70% through automated data processing and interactive visualization, enabling faster design iterations and more comprehensive reporting for offshore projects.

**Target Users**: Marine engineers, project managers, and technical reviewers working with OrcaFlex simulation results for offshore floating structures.

## Overview

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for browsing and visualizing results from the OrcaFlex analysis located at `D:\\1522\\ctr7\\orcaflex\\rev_a08\\output\\csv`. The system processes complex engineering data including:

- **Polar Response Plots**: Interactive visualization of response quantities $R(\theta)$ vs. environmental heading $\theta \in [0°, 345°]$ with $\Delta\theta = 15°$
- **Time Trace Analysis**: Detailed component-level response visualization $x(t)$ with statistical overlays including RMS: $x_{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T x(t)^2 dt}$
- **Multi-Level Filtering**: Analysis case, loading condition, and heading-based data exploration with Boolean logic: $F_{total} = F_{case} \land F_{loading} \land F_{heading}$
- **Professional Export**: Publication-ready charts and comprehensive reporting capabilities with engineering units and precision $\pm 0.1\%$

- **Story 3**: As a marine engineer, I want to filter results by specific analysis cases and loading conditions so I can focus on relevant design scenarios.

### Secondary User: Project Manager
- **Story 4**: As a project manager, I want to export professional charts and summary reports so I can present findings to clients and stakeholders.
- **Story 5**: As a project manager, I want to track analysis progress across multiple cases so I can manage project deliverables effectively.

### Technical Reviewer

## Data Structure Analysis

### File Organization Pattern
```
D:\\1522\\ctr7\\orcaflex\\rev_a08\\output\\csv/
├── 02c_005yr/          # 5-year return period analysis
├── 03c_100yr/          # 100-year return period analysis  
├── 03c_100yr_env_sens/ # Environmental sensitivity analysis
└── [other analysis cases]/
```

### Summary Files (dm_* pattern)
- **Polar Heading Data**: 24 headings $\theta_i = 15° \cdot i$ where $i \in [0, 23]$, spanning $\theta \in [0°, 345°]$
- **Component Types**: fst1, fst2 (floating structures), strut, jacket (fixed structures), lngc (vessel)
- **Response Quantities**: 
  - Displacement $\xi(t)$ in $\text{m}$
  - Acceleration $\ddot{\xi}(t)$ in $\text{m/s}^2$ 
  - Force $F(t)$ in $\text{kN}$
  - Moment $M(t)$ in $\text{kN⋅m}$
