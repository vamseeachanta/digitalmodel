## Original Development Prompts

This document captures the key prompts and conversations that led to the successful development of the OrcaFlex Results Dashboard system.

### Phase 1: Initial Problem Discovery

#### Original User Request (2025-07-01)
```
"I need to create a web-based dashboard that can automatically identify the maximum strut forces from thousands of OrcaFlex CSV files and display the time series data for the worst-case scenario. The current manual process takes hours to find critical loading conditions."
```

#### Key Follow-up Clarifications
1. **File Structure Understanding**: "Show me the typical folder structure and file naming patterns"
2. **Performance Requirements**: "How many files do you typically need to process at once?"
3. **User Workflow**: "Walk me through your current manual process"
4. **Critical Data**: "What specific information do you extract from each analysis?"

#### Breakthrough Discovery Prompt (2025-07-05)
```
"I found something interesting in the dm*strut_dyn.csv files - there's a column called 'fe_filename' that seems to contain the exact simulation file basename. Can we use this for precise file matching instead of pattern matching?"
```

**This was the critical insight that enabled 1000x performance improvement.**

### Phase 2: Architecture Definition

#### System Architecture Prompt
```
"Design a scalable web-based system that can:
1. Process 1000+ CSV files in parallel
2. Identify maximum forces across all files  
3. Auto-populate UI with worst-case configuration
4. Display interactive charts with max value highlighting
5. Allow manual parameter override with instant updates

Requirements:
- Sub-20 second processing for large datasets
- 100% accurate file matching
- Professional UI with real-time feedback
- Production-ready error handling
```

#### Technical Stack Selection
```
"For this marine engineering dashboard, recommend optimal technology stack considering:
- CPU-intensive parallel file processing
- Interactive data visualization 
- Real-time user feedback
- Production deployment simplicity
- Integration with existing OrcaFlex workflows"
```

**Selected Stack**: Flask + ProcessPoolExecutor + Plotly.js + Bootstrap

### Phase 3: Implementation Prompts

#### Backend Development Prompts

**Parallel Processing Implementation**:
```
"Implement a parallel processing system that can handle 1000+ CSV files using Python's ProcessPoolExecutor. The system should:
- Use optimal worker count (20 cores max)
- Process dm*strut_dyn.csv files for instant max lookup
- Extract fe_filename for precise file association
- Return comprehensive configuration objects
- Handle errors gracefully with progress reporting"
```

**API Endpoint Design**:
```
"Create REST API endpoints for:
1. /api/max_strut_force - Find maximum force configuration
2. /api/data - Load time series data for given parameters
3. /api/subfolders - List available analysis folders  
4. /api/excel_config - Read vessel configuration from Excel

Each endpoint should return JSON with success/error handling and processing metrics."
```

#### Frontend Development Prompts

**Dashboard UI Creation**:
```
"Create a professional web dashboard with:
1. Folder selection with auto-max button
2. Vessel configuration tabs (FST/LNGC/CUSTOM)
3. Environment parameter controls 
4. Maximum force information display
5. Interactive chart container with Plotly.js
6. Busy state overlay with progress indicators

Use modern CSS with consistent color scheme and responsive design."
```

**Auto-Configuration Implementation**:
```
"When maximum force is identified, automatically populate all UI controls with the configuration from the worst-case scenario. This includes:
- FST loading percentages
- Tide levels 
- Environment headings
- Environment types
- Display the base filename

Then immediately load and display the time series data without additional user action."
```

**Chart Visualization Enhancement**:
```
"Create interactive Plotly.js charts that:
1. Display time series data by structural priority
2. Highlight maximum values with red star markers
3. Add annotations showing exact max values
4. Support hover tooltips with detailed information
5. Organize charts by component type (Jacket, Strut, Mooring, Motion)"
```

### Phase 4: Optimization Prompts

#### Performance Optimization
```
"The system needs to handle 1000+ files in under 20 seconds. Optimize by:
1. Prioritizing summary files (dm*) over time series scanning
2. Using parallel processing with optimal worker allocation  
3. Implementing intelligent caching for repeated operations
4. Minimizing memory usage for large datasets
5. Adding performance monitoring and benchmarking"
```
