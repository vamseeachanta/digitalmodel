# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: OrcaFlex Examples Integration
> Created: 2024-12-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive system to download, convert, and analyze OrcaFlex example files from the official Orcina portal, converting them to YAML format and extracting key features for the OrcaFlex module agent's knowledge base. Additionally, extract and integrate comprehensive knowledge from the entire www.orcina.com website including documentation, theory guides, technical notes, and best practices for enhanced agent capabilities.

## User Stories

### OrcaFlex Engineer Story

As an OrcaFlex engineer, I want to have a comprehensive library of converted example files in YAML format, so that I can quickly reference and learn from official examples without manually downloading and converting each file.

The workflow involves:
1. Automated downloading of examples from Orcina's portal
2. Batch conversion of .dat/.sim files to .yml format
3. Systematic analysis of model features
4. Knowledge transfer to the module agent

### Module Agent Learning Story

As the OrcaFlex module agent, I want to analyze and learn from official examples and comprehensive Orcina documentation, so that I can provide expert guidance with deep theoretical understanding and practical implementation knowledge.

The agent will gain knowledge about:
- Common modeling patterns from examples
- Component configurations and best practices
- Analysis types and setups
- Industry-standard approaches
- Theoretical foundations from Orcina documentation
- API usage patterns and code examples
- Validation and verification procedures
- Troubleshooting guides and known issues
- Version-specific features and capabilities

## Spec Scope

1. **Example Downloader** - Automated system to fetch examples from Orcina portal
2. **Format Converter** - Batch conversion of OrcaFlex files to YAML format
3. **Feature Analyzer** - Extract and categorize model components and characteristics
4. **Knowledge Integrator** - Transfer analyzed data to module agent's knowledge base
5. **Documentation Generator** - Create searchable catalog of examples with features
6. **Website Knowledge Extractor** - Comprehensive extraction of Orcina website content including:
   - User manuals and documentation
   - Theory and technical guides
   - API documentation and code examples
   - Validation examples and benchmarks
   - FAQ and troubleshooting guides
   - Version release notes and feature updates
7. **Concept Mapper** - Map theoretical concepts to practical implementations
8. **Code Pattern Extractor** - Extract and catalog Python API usage patterns from documentation

## Out of Scope

- Modification of original example files
- Creation of new examples
- Real-time synchronization with Orcina portal
- GUI interface for browsing examples
- Running simulations on downloaded examples

## Expected Deliverable

1. All OrcaFlex examples downloaded and organized in `docs/modules/orcaflex/examples/`
2. All examples converted to YAML format with proper validation
3. Comprehensive feature analysis report for each example
4. Updated OrcaFlex module agent (`agents/orcaflex/`) with integrated example knowledge and website documentation
5. Searchable catalog/index of all examples with their key features
6. Enhanced agent context files in `agents/orcaflex/context/` with:
   - Extracted documentation knowledge
   - Code patterns and API usage examples
   - Theoretical concepts mapped to implementations
   - Troubleshooting guides and best practices

## Module Agent Integration

This specification explicitly targets the **OrcaFlex module agent** located at `agents/orcaflex/`. The knowledge extraction and integration will:

1. **Update Agent Knowledge Base**: All extracted knowledge will be integrated into the agent's context files
2. **Enhance Agent Capabilities**: Enable the agent to reference real examples and documentation
3. **Improve Code Generation**: Provide the agent with verified API patterns and best practices
4. **Enable Expert Guidance**: Allow the agent to cite official documentation and examples

The module agent will be able to:
- Reference specific examples when answering questions
- Provide code snippets based on official patterns
- Explain theoretical concepts with practical implementations
- Troubleshoot issues using official documentation
- Suggest best practices from Orcina's guidelines
