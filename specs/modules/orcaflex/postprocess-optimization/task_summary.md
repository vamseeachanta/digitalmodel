    file_list,
    num_threads=None,  # Auto-detect
    config={'performance_report': 'metrics.json'}
)
```

### To Monitor Performance:
```python

## Additional Testing (2024-12-24 20:42)

### Hybrid Parallelization Testing ⚠️
**Status: Thread Affinity Issues Encountered**
- Created `single_file_parallel_test.py` to test hybrid approaches
- **Finding**: OrcaFlex has thread affinity requirements - model operations must happen on the same thread that loaded the model
- **Error**: "Thread affinity error (This function must be called on the thread to which the model has affinity.)"
- **Implication**: Cannot parallelize analysis operations within a single OrcaFlex model across threads
- **Conclusion**: OrcaFlex API enforces single-threaded model operations after loading

### Key Technical Constraint Discovered
**OrcaFlex Thread Affinity Requirement**:
- Once a model is loaded, ALL operations on that model must occur on the SAME thread
- This prevents parallelizing analysis operations within a single model
- File-level parallelization (multiple files) remains the only viable approach
- The hybrid approach (1-2 files with parallel analysis) is NOT feasible with OrcaFlex API

## 🚨 CRITICAL WAY FORWARD

### Immediate Action Required: Implement Hybrid Parallelization Strategy
**Based on baseline findings and testing, the optimal solution appears to be a HYBRID approach**

#### Key Discovery
- Default of 30 threads is **WORSE** than 15 threads for large files when loading multiple files simultaneously
- We've been running sub-optimally this entire time
- 15% performance left on the table due to wrong defaults

#### 🎯 OPTIMAL SOLUTION REFINED (Based on Testing)
**Original Hypothesis**: Hybrid approach with 1-2 files and parallel analysis within each
**Testing Result**: ❌ NOT FEASIBLE - OrcaFlex API has thread affinity constraints

**Technical Constraint Discovered**:
- OrcaFlex models have **strict thread affinity** - all operations must occur on the loading thread
- Cannot parallelize analysis operations within a single model
- This is an API-level restriction that cannot be circumvented

**Revised Optimal Solution**:
- **Continue with file-level parallelization** but with FEWER threads (10-15)
- **Focus on reducing I/O contention** rather than analysis parallelization
- **Batch files by size** to optimize thread allocation per batch

#### Recommended Actions (Revised After Testing)
1. **URGENT**: Update all default thread counts from 30 to 15 across repository
2. **Implement file-size-based thread allocation**:
   - Dynamically adjust threads based on file size
   - Fewer threads for larger files (I/O bound)
   - More threads for smaller files (CPU bound)
3. **Update YAML configs**: dm_fsts.yml, dm_fsts_lngc.yml with optimal thread counts
4. **Update Python defaults**: Change hardcoded `num_threads=30` to `num_threads=15`
5. **Focus on I/O optimization**: Since analysis parallelization isn't possible

#### Thread Count Guidelines (Final - Based on Constraints)
**File-Level Parallelization Only (OrcaFlex Constraint)**:
- **Small files (<100MB)**: 20-30 parallel files
- **Medium files (100-500MB)**: 15-20 parallel files
- **Large files (500MB-1GB)**: 10-15 parallel files
- **Very large files (>1GB)**: 5-10 parallel files
- **Mixed batches**: Group by size, process each group with appropriate thread count

### Next Steps (Updated Priority)
1. **FIRST**: Fix all thread defaults across repository (new urgent task)
2. Complete Phase 3 remaining tasks:
   - Task 3.2: NUMA-Aware Processing
   - Task 3.3: JIT Compilation with Numba
3. Move to Phase 4: Testing & Benchmarking
4. Run comprehensive production benchmarks
5. Create performance regression test suite
