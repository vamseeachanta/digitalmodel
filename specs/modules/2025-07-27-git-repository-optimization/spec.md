# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Git Repository Size Optimization
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive git repository size reduction for both local and origin repositories to optimize storage, improve clone times, and enhance development workflow performance. This feature will analyze current repository bloat, remove large files from history, and establish preventive measures for future size management.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the git repository optimization spec to include:
- Additional git history cleaning tools and techniques
- New large file detection and removal strategies  
- Enhanced repository maintenance automation
- Updated force-push safety procedures
- Additional preventive measures for size management
Maintain compatibility with existing development workflows and preserve essential git history and functionality.
```

## User Stories

### Repository Size Analysis and Cleanup

As a **developer**, I want to **analyze and reduce our git repository size with configurable history retention**, so that **clone times are faster, storage usage is optimized, and development workflows are more efficient while preserving important commit history**.

The current repository has grown large due to accumulated backup files, large binary files, and extensive commit history. This impacts new developer onboarding (slow clones), CI/CD performance, and storage costs. The solution will identify size contributors, safely remove large objects from history, optimize repository structure, and implement ongoing size management practices while allowing users to specify how much commit history to preserve.

### Origin Repository Optimization

As a **team lead**, I want to **optimize the origin repository size on GitHub/remote**, so that **all team members benefit from improved performance and reduced bandwidth usage**.

After local optimization, the changes need to be safely propagated to the origin repository. This includes coordinating with team members, handling force-push operations safely, and ensuring all local repositories are updated to reflect the optimized history.

### Configurable History Retention

As a **project maintainer**, I want to **configure how much commit history to preserve during optimization**, so that **I can balance repository size reduction with historical data retention needs**.

The system should provide flexible options for history retention including: preserving last N commits (e.g., last 100, 500, 1000 commits), preserving commits from last N months (e.g., last 6, 12, 24 months), preserving commits since a specific date, or keeping complete history while only removing large files. This allows different projects to choose the appropriate balance between size optimization and historical preservation.

### Preventive Size Management

As a **project maintainer**, I want to **implement preventive measures for repository size management**, so that **the repository doesn't grow excessively large again in the future**.

This includes updating .gitignore files, implementing pre-commit hooks for large file detection, establishing repository maintenance procedures, and educating the team on best practices for keeping repository size manageable.

## Spec Scope

1. **Repository Analysis** - Comprehensive analysis of current repository size, identification of large objects, commit history analysis, and size growth patterns
2. **User Configuration Interface** - Interactive prompts for history retention options including last N commits, last N months, specific date cutoffs, or complete history preservation
3. **Large File Removal** - Safe removal of large files from git history using appropriate tools (git filter-repo, BFG Repo-Cleaner, or git filter-branch) with configurable history retention
4. **History Truncation** - Optional commit history truncation based on user-specified retention policies while preserving repository integrity
5. **Repository Optimization** - Git garbage collection, repository repacking, and structure optimization for improved performance
6. **Origin Synchronization** - Safe coordination and execution of origin repository updates with proper team communication
7. **Preventive Measures** - Implementation of .gitignore updates, pre-commit hooks, and maintenance procedures to prevent future bloat

## Out of Scope

- Migration to Git LFS (Large File Storage) - this would be a separate future enhancement
- Complete repository history rewrite beyond large file removal
- Changes to branching strategy or workflow processes
- Automated deployment pipeline modifications beyond repository optimization

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Optimized Local Repository** - Significantly reduced .git folder size with large files removed from history and repository structure optimized
2. **Updated Origin Repository** - Remote repository synchronized with local optimizations, with all team members coordinated on the changes
3. **Preventive Infrastructure** - Updated .gitignore files, pre-commit hooks for large file detection, and documented maintenance procedures for ongoing size management
