# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: OpenFOAM Capabilities Development
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Develop comprehensive OpenFOAM integration capabilities for the DigitalModel platform, enabling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis for marine and offshore engineering applications. This feature will establish the ecosystem, documentation, and core CFD capabilities for hull analysis and other marine structures.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the OpenFOAM capabilities spec to include:
- Additional CFD analysis types (multiphase flows, turbulence models)
- Integration with existing modules (OrcaFlex, AQWA)
- Performance optimization for large-scale simulations
- Advanced post-processing and visualization
Maintain compatibility with existing Linux installations and preserve the established configuration-driven approach.
```

## User Stories

### OpenFOAM Environment Setup

As an offshore engineer, I want to set up OpenFOAM on my Linux systems (AceEngineer and ACMA machines), so that I can perform CFD analyses as part of my digital modeling workflow.

The workflow includes installing OpenFOAM with proper dependencies, configuring the environment for both local and remote execution, creating standardized installation procedures, and verifying the installation with test cases. This enables engineers to quickly deploy OpenFOAM across different Linux environments.

### CFD Analysis for Hull Design

As a naval architect, I want to perform CFD analysis on hull geometries, so that I can evaluate hydrodynamic performance, resistance, and flow characteristics.

Users will define hull geometry through CAD files or parametric definitions, configure CFD analysis parameters via YAML files, execute OpenFOAM simulations with appropriate mesh generation, and visualize results including pressure distributions, velocity fields, and drag coefficients. This provides critical insights for hull optimization and performance prediction.

### Automated Test Case Management

As a CFD engineer, I want standardized test cases for validation, so that I can verify OpenFOAM functionality and benchmark performance across different scenarios.

The system will provide pre-configured test cases for common marine CFD scenarios, automated mesh generation and simulation setup, comparison tools for validation against experimental or analytical data, and performance benchmarking utilities. This ensures reliable and validated CFD results.

## Spec Scope

1. **OpenFOAM Ecosystem Development** - Installation guides, environment configuration, and dependency management for Linux systems
2. **CFD Module Architecture** - Core module structure following DigitalModel patterns with YAML-based configuration
3. **Hull Analysis Capabilities** - Mesh generation, boundary conditions, solver configuration, and post-processing for hull CFD
4. **Test Case Framework** - Standardized test cases for validation and benchmarking of CFD capabilities
5. **Documentation System** - Comprehensive user guides, API documentation, and example workflows

## Out of Scope

- Windows installation support (Linux-only for initial release)
- GUI development (command-line and configuration-based only)
- Real-time CFD simulation monitoring
- Cloud-based execution infrastructure
- Integration with commercial CFD pre-processors

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional OpenFOAM installation on AceEngineer and ACMA Linux machines with verification scripts
2. CFD module integrated into DigitalModel with hull analysis capabilities demonstrable via test cases
3. Complete documentation suite including installation guides, user manual, and API reference accessible via project docs
