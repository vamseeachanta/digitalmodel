# Create Spec Instructions

## Overview
This instruction set guides the creation of detailed specification documents for new features and functionality.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
- Collect user requirements and business context
- Clarify scope and boundaries
- Identify technical constraints

### Step 2: Create Specification Structure
- Create spec folder in `specs/modules/<module>/` following repository pattern
- Generate main spec.md with all required sections
- **MANDATORY**: Create prompt.md with prompt history and curated reuse prompt
- **MANDATORY**: Create task_summary.md with executive summary, findings, and way forward
- Create sub-specifications as needed

### Step 3: Document Technical Approach
- Define implementation strategy
- Identify dependencies and integrations
- Plan testing approach

### Step 4: Create Task Breakdown
- Break down work into manageable tasks
- Estimate effort and dependencies
- Create actionable task list

## File Structure
```
specs/modules/<module>/spec-name/
├── spec.md
├── prompt.md              # MANDATORY - prompt history and reuse prompt
├── task_summary.md        # MANDATORY - executive summary, updated as spec progresses
├── tasks.md
└── sub-specs/
    ├── technical-spec.md
    ├── api-spec.md (if needed)
    ├── database-schema.md (if needed)
    └── tests.md
```

**Note**: Following repository pattern, all specs MUST be created in `specs/modules/<module>/` structure.

## Templates

### Main Spec Template
```markdown
# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: [SPEC_NAME]
> Created: [DATE]
> Status: Planning

## Overview
[Brief description of what this spec accomplishes]

## User Stories
[User-focused descriptions of functionality]

## Spec Scope
[What is included in this specification]

## Expected Deliverable
[Measurable outcomes and success criteria]
```

### MANDATORY Prompt Template
Every spec MUST include a `prompt.md` file with this structure:
```markdown
# Prompt History and Reuse Template

> Created: [DATE]  
> Spec: [SPEC_NAME]  
> Location: specs/modules/[MODULE]/[SPEC_NAME]/

## Curated Reuse Prompt

### For Similar Specifications
```
[Refined prompt that can be reused for similar spec creation, incorporating lessons learned]
```

### Key Parameters
- **Module**: [TARGET_MODULE]
- **Scope**: [COMPLEXITY_LEVEL] 
- **Integration Points**: [INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS]
- **Success Criteria**: [MEASURABLE_OUTCOMES]

### Reuse Guidelines
- [Guidelines for when and how to reuse this prompt]
- [Customization points for different contexts]
- [Common variations and their applications]

## Lessons Learned
- [Key insights from creating this specification]
- [What worked well in the prompt formulation]
- [What could be improved for future similar requests]

## Prompt History (Reverse Chronological)

### Latest Request - [DATE]
```
[Most recent user prompt or modification request]
```

### Original Request - [DATE]
```
[EXACT original user prompt that initiated this spec creation]
```

### Context at Time of Creation
- **Session Context**: [Brief description of session context]
- **Repository State**: [Current state, recent changes, etc.]
- **Related Work**: [Any related specifications or ongoing work]
```

## MANDATORY Requirements

### For Every /create-spec Command
1. **Repository Pattern**: Spec MUST be created in `specs/modules/<module>/`
2. **Prompt Documentation**: MUST create prompt.md with complete history
3. **Task Summary**: MUST create task_summary.md with executive summary, findings, and way forward
4. **Template Compliance**: All files must follow established templates
5. **Cross-References**: Update relevant module READMEs and indices
6. **Progress Updates**: MUST update task_summary.md as specification progresses

### MANDATORY Task Summary Template
Every spec MUST include a `task_summary.md` file with this structure:
```markdown
# Task Summary

> Spec: [SPEC_NAME]  
> Created: [DATE]  
> Last Updated: [DATE]  
> Status: [Planning/In Progress/Complete/On Hold]  
> Progress: [X]% Complete

## Executive Summary
[Concise overview of the specification purpose, scope, and current status]

## Key Findings
[Major discoveries, insights, or conclusions from research/analysis]

## Current Status
### Completed
- [List of completed tasks/deliverables]

### In Progress  
- [Current active work items]

### Pending
- [Upcoming tasks/dependencies]

## Way Forward
### Next Steps
1. [Immediate next actions]
2. [Follow-up tasks]
3. [Future considerations]

### Decisions Required
- [Key decisions needed from stakeholders]
- [Resource allocation needs]
- [Timeline considerations]

### Success Criteria
- [Measurable outcomes for completion]
- [Quality gates and validation criteria]
```

**Update Requirements**: task_summary.md MUST be updated whenever:
- Spec status changes
- Major milestones are completed
- Key findings or insights are discovered
- Decisions are made that affect scope or approach
- Implementation begins or completes

This creates a comprehensive specification with reusable prompt intelligence and continuous progress tracking for stakeholder visibility.

### Step 12a: Assign Agents to Tasks

<step_metadata>
  <assigns>agents to each task</assigns>
  <creates>specialist agents as needed</creates>
  <optimizes>cost with free agents</optimizes>
</step_metadata>

<agent_assignment_strategy>
  <complexity_based>
    - Simple tasks (< 30 min): Free agents when available
    - Moderate tasks (30 min - 2 hours): General-purpose or free agents  
    - Complex tasks (2-6 hours): Specialist agents
    - Extensive tasks (> 6 hours): Domain expert agents
  </complexity_based>
  
  <domain_detection>
    - Database tasks: SQL specialist
    - API tasks: REST/GraphQL specialist
    - Frontend tasks: UI/React specialist
    - Testing tasks: Test automation specialist
    - Documentation: Technical writing specialist
  </domain_detection>
  
  <cost_optimization>
    - Prioritize free agents for simple tasks
    - Reuse existing specialists
    - Create new specialists only when needed
    - Weekly refresh of free agent pool
  </cost_optimization>
</agent_assignment_strategy>

<agent_creation_process>
  IF task_requires_specialist AND no_specialist_exists:
    CREATE specialist_agent using /create-module-agent
    CONFIGURE with domain-specific capabilities
    REGISTER in agent_registry
  ELSE:
    ASSIGN existing_appropriate_agent
</agent_creation_process>

<task_update_format>
  Each task will be updated with agent assignment:
  - [ ] 1. Task description `[time]` 🤖 `Agent: agent_name (type)`
</task_update_format>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Analyze each task for complexity and domain
  ASSIGN: Appropriate agent (free, general, or specialist)
  CREATE: Specialist agents as needed
  UPDATE: tasks.md with agent assignments
  MAINTAIN: Weekly refresh of free agents
</instructions>

</step>
