## Test Coverage

### Repository Analysis Tests

**Repository Size Calculation**
- Verify accurate calculation of repository size before optimization
- Test identification of largest objects and files in repository history
- Validate branch and tag inventory accuracy
- Confirm large file detection algorithms identify correct targets

**Analysis Tool Functionality**
- Test git commands for repository analysis (`git count-objects`, `git rev-list`)
- Verify git-filter-repo installation and basic functionality
- Validate backup creation and verification procedures
- Test repository integrity checking with `git fsck`

### Repository Optimization Tests

**Large File Removal**
- Test git-filter-repo with various filtering expressions and file patterns
- Verify repository history preservation for non-targeted files
- Validate branch and tag handling during history rewriting
- Test incremental filtering for different file types and sizes

**Repository Structure Optimization**
- Test garbage collection effectiveness (`git gc --aggressive`)
- Verify repository repacking and compression results
- Validate configuration optimizations for repository performance
- Test repository size measurement accuracy after optimization

### Safety and Recovery Tests

**Backup and Recovery**
- Test complete repository backup creation and restoration procedures
- Verify backup integrity and completeness before optimization operations
- Validate rollback procedures for emergency recovery scenarios
- Test repository clone verification after optimization

**Repository Integrity**
- Test `git fsck` for repository corruption detection after optimization
- Verify all branches and tags remain functional post-optimization
- Validate commit history integrity and accessibility
- Test repository functionality with development tools and workflows

### Origin Synchronization Tests

**Force-Push Safety**
- Test team coordination procedures for origin repository updates
- Verify force-push protection mechanisms and safety checks
- Validate team member notification and update coordination
- Test origin repository backup and recovery procedures

**Team Workflow Impact**
- Test impact on active development branches and ongoing work
- Verify team member repository update procedures and success
- Validate CI/CD pipeline functionality after origin optimization
- Test development tool compatibility with optimized repository

### Preventive Measures Tests

**Pre-commit Hook Testing**
- Test large file detection and blocking in pre-commit hooks
- Verify hook installation and configuration across development environments
- Validate file size threshold accuracy and customization
- Test hook bypass procedures for legitimate large file scenarios

**.gitignore Effectiveness**
- Test updated .gitignore rules for preventing large file commits
- Verify pattern matching accuracy for backup files and build artifacts
- Validate .gitignore rule precedence and interaction
- Test .gitignore synchronization across team repositories

## Mocking Requirements

- **Git Command Responses:** Mock git command outputs for testing analysis algorithms without requiring large test repositories
- **File System Operations:** Mock file system interactions for testing backup and recovery procedures safely
- **Network Operations:** Mock origin repository interactions for testing push/pull operations without affecting remote repositories
- **Team Coordination:** Mock team member responses and coordination workflows for testing communication procedures
