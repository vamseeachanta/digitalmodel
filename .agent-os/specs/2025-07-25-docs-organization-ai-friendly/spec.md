# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI-Friendly Documentation Organization
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Reorganize the `docs/` folder structure to create an AI-friendly system that enables efficient navigation, maintenance, and future development by AI agents and human developers. This reorganization will establish clear organizational patterns, metadata systems, and navigation aids that make the extensive engineering documentation more accessible and maintainable.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the docs organization spec to include:
- New documentation categories or types
- Additional AI-friendly features or metadata
- Navigation improvements or cross-reference systems
- Integration with new development workflows
Maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation paths and preserve all technical content while improving discoverability and organization.
```

## User Stories

### Engineering Documentation Navigator

As an AI agent, I want to quickly understand the scope and organization of engineering documentation, so that I can provide accurate guidance on technical topics and locate relevant resources efficiently.

**Detailed workflow**: When asked about a specific engineering topic (e.g., "cathodic protection design"), the AI agent should be able to identify the relevant documentation category, understand the relationship between different content types (theory, calculations, code, references), and provide a comprehensive response that draws from appropriate sources.

### Development Assistant

As a developer working on new engineering modules, I want to understand the existing documentation patterns and locate relevant reference materials, so that I can follow established conventions and build upon existing knowledge.

**Detailed workflow**: When implementing a new analysis module, the developer (human or AI) should be able to identify similar existing modules, understand the documentation structure they should follow, and locate relevant industry standards, calculation methods, and implementation examples.

### Knowledge Maintainer  

As a technical documentation maintainer, I want a clear organizational system that separates active content from legacy content and provides metadata about content relevance, so that I can efficiently update and maintain documentation quality.

**Detailed workflow**: When reviewing documentation for updates, the maintainer should be able to identify outdated content, understand content relationships and dependencies, and update information systematically without breaking cross-references or losing valuable historical context.

## Spec Scope

1. **Hierarchical Reorganization** - Restructure the current prefix-based system into a clear hierarchical organization with consistent naming patterns
2. **Metadata Integration** - Add frontmatter and structured metadata to all markdown files for improved AI navigation and content management
3. **Navigation System** - Create index files, category guides, and cross-reference systems to enable efficient content discovery
4. **Content Lifecycle Management** - Establish clear indicators for active, legacy, and deprecated content with proper archival organization
5. **AI-Friendly Enhancements** - Implement structured data, semantic relationships, and machine-readable content descriptors

## Out of Scope

- Content quality improvements or technical accuracy reviews
- Migration of content to different file formats
- Creation of new engineering documentation or technical content
- Implementation of web-based or database-driven documentation systems
- Integration with external documentation platforms or tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Reorganized docs/ structure** with clear hierarchical organization and consistent naming patterns that AI agents can navigate predictably
2. **Comprehensive navigation system** including master index, category guides, and cross-reference mappings that enable efficient content discovery
3. **Metadata-enhanced documentation** with structured frontmatter in all markdown files providing machine-readable content descriptors and relationships
