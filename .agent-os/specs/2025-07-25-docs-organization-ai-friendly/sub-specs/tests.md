## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Content Migration Scripts**
- Test frontmatter generation for various content types
- Test path transformation from old to new structure
- Test symlink creation and validation
- Test content categorization logic
- Test metadata extraction from existing files

**Validation Scripts**
- Test markdown frontmatter validation
- Test link checking functionality
- Test cross-reference integrity
- Test duplicate content detection
- Test missing file identification

### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Migration Workflow**
- Test complete migration of a sample directory structure
- Test backward compatibility through symlinks
- Test navigation system generation
- Test index file creation and updates
- Test cross-reference system functionality

**AI Navigation Scenarios**
- Test AI agent content discovery workflows
- Test semantic search through metadata
- Test category-based content retrieval
- Test related content suggestions
- Test content lifecycle status filtering

### File System Tests

**Structure Validation**
- Test new directory structure creation
- Test file permission preservation during migration
- Test content integrity after moves
- Test symlink validity and targets
- Test cleanup of empty directories

### Validation Tests

**Content Quality Assurance**
- Test all markdown files have valid frontmatter
- Test all internal links resolve correctly  
- Test all category assignments are valid
- Test metadata consistency across related files
- Test no orphaned or unreachable content

**Navigation System Tests**
- Test master index completeness and accuracy
- Test category index file generation
- Test cross-reference map accuracy
- Test tag consistency and coverage
- Test search functionality through metadata

## Mocking Requirements

- **File System Operations:** Mock file moves and symlink creation for safe testing
- **Git Operations:** Mock git history tracking during content migration
- **Path Resolution:** Mock complex path transformations for validation testing
- **Content Parsing:** Mock markdown and frontmatter parsing for various content formats

## Performance Tests

**Migration Performance**
- Test migration script performance with large content sets
- Test memory usage during bulk frontmatter processing
- Test concurrent file operations safety
- Test symlink resolution performance

**Navigation Performance**  
- Test index generation time with full content set
- Test search performance through metadata
- Test cross-reference resolution speed
- Test category filtering response time

## Edge Case Testing

**Content Variations**
- Test files with existing frontmatter
- Test files with special characters in names
- Test files with complex internal link patterns
- Test binary files mixed with documentation
- Test deeply nested directory structures

**Error Conditions**
- Test handling of duplicate content
- Test migration of broken or corrupted files
- Test conflicts in new path structure
- Test incomplete or interrupted migrations
- Test rollback procedures for failed migrations

## Acceptance Criteria Testing

**Navigation Effectiveness**
- Verify AI agents can locate content 90% faster than current structure
- Verify all major engineering domains have complete navigation paths
- Verify cross-references enable discovery of related content
- Verify metadata enables filtering and categorization

**Migration Success**
- Verify 100% of content preserved during migration
- Verify all existing links continue to work through compatibility layer
- Verify new structure reduces average path depth by 50%
- Verify metadata coverage reaches 100% of markdown files
