## Overview

Integrate Agent OS development framework into this Python-based digital engineering modeling library repository to enable multi-system team collaboration with trunk-based development, automated git bash workflows, and synchronized sub-agents. This integration will provide structured spec creation, task management, and standardized documentation processes optimized for distributed offshore engineering teams working on digital models, CAD integration, analytical calculations, and computational modeling applications.

## User Stories

### Multi-System Offshore Engineering Team Collaboration

As an offshore engineering developer working on this digital modeling library across multiple systems, I want to use Agent OS with trunk-based development and automated git bash scripts, so that I can collaborate seamlessly with team members while maintaining consistent workflows and synchronized states for both engineering model development and FEA validation tasks.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer creates new offshore engineering spec using `/create-spec` command
2. The system automatically creates trunk-based git branch for this digital engineering spec
3. Sub-agents are configured in .agent-os folder for offshore engineering team synchronization
4. Git bash scripts automate Python engineering tasks, model validation, and FEA execution
5. All team members work on main branch with feature flags and continuous integration for engineering features
6. Spec completion automatically merges changes and updates the digital engineering library state

### System-Level Agent OS Installation for Digital Engineering

As an offshore engineering team member setting up this digital modeling project on my system, I want Agent OS to be properly installed at the system level for my operating system, so that I can use the framework consistently for Python digital engineering and CAD modeling work regardless of whether I'm on Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unix, with all commands and tools properly configured for offshore engineering environments.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System detects current operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix)
