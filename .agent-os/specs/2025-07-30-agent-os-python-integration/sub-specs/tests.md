# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-python-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Agent OS Product Documentation**
- Verify all product documentation files exist and contain required sections
- Validate YAML configuration file structure and content
- Test documentation cross-references and file paths

**Development Standards Files**
- Verify code style standards are properly formatted and complete
- Test best practices documentation includes engineering-specific patterns
- Validate Python-specific and scientific computing standards

**Template Files**
- Test that all template files are properly structured
- Verify template variables are correctly defined
- Validate template content matches specifications

### Integration Tests

**Agent OS Workflow Integration**
- Test complete spec creation workflow using new templates
- Verify task execution follows Python package development patterns
- Test integration with existing codebase patterns

**Documentation Generation**
- Test automated generation of cross-references
- Verify documentation links and file paths are correct
- Test integration with existing CLAUDE.md configuration

**Configuration Validation**
- Test YAML configuration validation patterns
- Verify engineering-specific configuration templates
- Test integration with poetry and modern Python tooling

### Feature Tests

**Python Package Development Workflow**
- End-to-end test of creating new engineering analysis module using Agent OS
- Test integration with poetry package management
- Verify pytest integration and testing patterns

**Engineering Analysis Module Creation**
- Test creation of new mathematical analysis module following templates
- Verify proper unit handling and engineering standard references
- Test mock integration patterns for licensed software

**Legacy Code Enhancement**
- Test enhancement of existing code using Agent OS patterns
- Verify preservation of engineering domain knowledge
- Test modernization of dependency management patterns

### Mocking Requirements

- **File System Operations:** Mock file creation and modification for testing without affecting actual project structure
- **User Input Simulation:** Mock user responses for interactive Agent OS workflows
- **Git Operations:** Mock git commands for testing branch and commit operations
- **External Tool Integration:** Mock interactions with poetry, pytest, and uv commands

## Engineering-Specific Test Considerations

### Domain Knowledge Preservation
- Test that engineering analysis patterns are maintained during code modernization
- Verify industry standard references are preserved in updated code
- Validate mathematical model integrity during refactoring

### Licensed Software Testing
- Test mock integration patterns for OrcaFlex API
- Verify graceful handling of missing licensed software dependencies
- Test fallback mechanisms when commercial software is unavailable

### Scientific Computing Validation
- Test numerical analysis patterns and unit handling
- Verify mathematical model validation approaches
- Test integration with scientific Python ecosystem (numpy, scipy, pandas)

## Test Execution Strategy

### Continuous Integration
- Run all unit tests on every commit
- Execute integration tests on pull requests
- Perform feature tests on release candidates

### Performance Testing
- Validate that Agent OS integration doesn't impact analysis performance
- Test file processing speed with large YAML configurations
- Monitor memory usage during documentation generation

### Regression Testing
- Ensure existing engineering analysis modules continue to function
- Verify backward compatibility of configuration formats
- Test that industry standard compliance is maintained
