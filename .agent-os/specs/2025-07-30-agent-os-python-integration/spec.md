> Spec: Agent OS Integration for Digital Model Python Package
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the existing Agent OS integration for the digitalmodel Python package to fully support Python-specific workflows, mathematical/scientific computing patterns, and modern Python tooling (poetry, pytest, uv). This integration will establish comprehensive development standards tailored for scientific computing and offshore engineering analysis workflows.

## User Stories

### Python Package Development Workflow

As an offshore engineer, I want Agent OS to understand Python package development patterns so that I can maintain consistency across mathematical modeling modules and engineering analysis components.

**Detailed Workflow**: The system should recognize Python module structures, YAML configuration patterns, and scientific computing conventions specific to engineering analysis. It should guide development of new analysis modules following established patterns for OrcaFlex integration, AQWA processing, and mathematical computations.

### Scientific Computing Collaboration

As a research engineer collaborating on mathematical models, I want Agent OS to enforce scientific computing best practices so that analyses are reproducible, well-documented, and follow engineering standards.

**Detailed Workflow**: Agent OS should ensure proper unit handling, mathematical notation in comments, engineering standard references, and consistent approach to numerical methods. It should guide creation of test cases that validate against analytical solutions and industry benchmarks.

### Legacy Code Modernization

As a maintainer of existing engineering analysis code, I want Agent OS to help modernize legacy patterns while preserving engineering domain knowledge so that the codebase remains reliable while becoming more maintainable.

**Detailed Workflow**: The system should guide refactoring of existing modules while maintaining engineering context, domain-specific calculations, and industry standard compliance. It should help migrate from legacy dependency management to modern Python tooling.

## Spec Scope

1. **Python Package Structure Enhancement** - Extend current Agent OS setup with Python-specific development patterns and scientific computing standards
2. **Engineering Domain Standards** - Establish code style and development practices specific to offshore/marine engineering analysis
3. **Modern Python Tooling Integration** - Configure standards for poetry, pytest, uv, and scientific Python ecosystem
4. **Mathematical Computing Guidelines** - Define patterns for numerical analysis, unit handling, and engineering calculations
5. **Testing Framework Enhancement** - Establish comprehensive testing patterns for engineering analysis modules with mock integrations

## Out of Scope

- Modifying existing functional analysis code without specific engineering requirements
- Creating new analysis modules (this spec focuses on development framework only)
- Changing fundamental engineering methodologies or industry standards compliance

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete Agent OS product documentation** reflecting the current state and Python-specific patterns
2. **Enhanced development standards** for Python scientific computing and engineering analysis
3. **Comprehensive task templates** for common Python package development workflows in engineering context
