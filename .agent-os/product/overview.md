- **Documentation**: Markdown, YAML configurations

## Development Workflow

### Specification-First Development
All features follow this structured approach:
1. **Specification First**: Features start with specs in `.agent-os/projects/` or `.ai/specs/`
2. **Configuration Templates**: Create/modify YAML configs in `base_configs/modules/`
3. **Module Implementation**: Implement analysis logic in `modules/`
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests with mock APIs where needed
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs in `docs/` directory

### Configuration-Driven Architecture
- **YAML files** drive most analysis workflows
- **Single source of truth**: ASCII inputs generate multiple output types
- **Modularity**: Engineering assets imported via .yml files
- **Reusability**: Components designed for cross-project use

### Special Considerations

#### OrcaFlex Integration
- Requires commercial license for full functionality
- Use mock API patterns for testing without license
- Graceful fallback mechanisms when license unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling for license issues

#### Domain Expertise Requirements
- Code contains deep offshore engineering knowledge
- Follow API, DNV, ABS industry standards
- Maintain traceability to engineering specifications
- Include references to relevant codes in comments

#### YAML Configuration Primacy
- Primary interface for most functionality
- Extensive configuration validation required
- Template configs for common analysis patterns
- User configs extend base configuration templates

#### Result Format Standards
- Typically CSV, Excel formats for data exchange
- PNG/PDF for visualization outputs
- HTML reports for comprehensive results
- Pandas DataFrames for internal processing
