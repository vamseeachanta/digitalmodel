## 🚀 Recommendations for v2.1 (Next Minor Update)

### When to Update to v2.1

Update when any of these occur:
1. **Feature ships from v1.5 roadmap** → Move to "Currently Implemented"
2. **Actual adoption metrics available** → Update "Adoption & Scale" section
3. **New competitor emerges** → Update "Competitive Landscape"
4. **User persona insights** → Refine pain points/goals
5. **Risk resolves or new risk emerges** → Update "Risk Mitigation"

### Potential v2.1 Additions

**Consider adding:**
- **User Testimonials** - Real quotes from early adopters
- **Case Studies** - Example projects/analyses completed
- **Pricing Model** - If open source + commercial support
- **Community Contribution** - If open sourcing parts of codebase
- **Technical Architecture** - High-level system design diagram

3. **Multi-dimensional metrics** - Business + technical + adoption + quality
4. **Show roadmap clarity** - Current vs future capabilities
5. **Demonstrate risk awareness** - Shows maturity and planning
6. **Ecosystem thinking** - Position within larger strategy
