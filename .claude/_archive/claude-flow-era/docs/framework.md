## Framework Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Context
Provide AI agents with maximum context about:
- Project purpose and objectives
- Technical architecture and constraints
- User personas and requirements
- Development processes and standards
- Historical implementation patterns

### 2. Role-Based Personas
Define specific AI agent personas with:
- Clear responsibilities and scope
- Decision-making authority
- Interaction patterns with other personas
- Quality gates and validation criteria

### 3. Systematic Workflows
Establish structured workflows for:
- Epic and feature development
- Bug fixing and maintenance
- Code review and quality assurance
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

### 4. Traceability and History
Maintain comprehensive records of:
- Implementation decisions and rationale
- Code changes and their impacts
- Requirements evolution
- Architecture decisions

### 5. Continuous Alignment
Regular validation that:
- Code aligns with documented requirements
- Architecture matches current implementation
- Documentation reflects actual system behavior
- Workflows remain effective and relevant

## Implementation Guidelines

### Requirement IDs
All requirements use hierarchical IDs:
- `R001` - Top-level requirement
- `R001.1` - Sub-requirement
- `R001.1.1` - Detailed requirement
- `R001.1.1.a` - Implementation detail

### File Naming Conventions
- Requirements: `R###-descriptive-name.md`
- Workflows: `descriptive-workflow.md`
- Personas: `assigned-role-name.md`
- Implementation History: `type-issue-###.md`
- System Overview: `component-name.md`

### Cross-Reference Standards
- Link requirements to implementations
- Reference personas in workflows
- Connect issues to requirements
- Maintain bidirectional traceability

## Implementation Epic

**Implementation Plan**: This framework is being implemented according to the epic specification:
`.ai/specs/infrastructure/epic-ai-framework-implementation-2025.md`

The epic defines a 9-month implementation plan with three phases:
1. **Framework Foundation** (Q1 2025) - Core structure and documentation
2. **Workflow Implementation** (Q2 2025) - Operational processes
3. **Implementation History** (Q3 2025) - Learning and improvement system

See the epic specification for detailed timeline, resource allocation, and success metrics.
