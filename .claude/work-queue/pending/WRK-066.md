# Review and Improve digitalmodel Module Structure for Discoverability

## What
Audit the current digitalmodel repository layout, simplify the module hierarchy, and improve discoverability. The repo name is `digitalmodel` and all subpackages should be clearly discoverable modules within it. Currently, modules are hard to find in a straightforward manner.

## Why
The current layout is confusing — `digitalmodel` is the repo and everything else should be a clearly discoverable module within it. Poor organization makes it difficult for users (and AI agents) to locate functionality, increases onboarding friction, and leads to duplicated or misplaced code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Current module structure audited and documented (as-is map)
- [ ] Proposed simplified hierarchy designed (to-be map)
- [ ] Naming conventions standardized across all modules
- [ ] Module organization follows clear, discoverable patterns
- [ ] Top-level `__init__.py` or module index provides discoverability
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new structure
- [ ] All existing imports and tests updated for new paths
- [ ] No regressions — all existing tests pass after restructuring

Modules are hard to find in a straightforward manner. Need to audit the current structure, simplify the hierarchy, and improve discoverability (naming, organization, documentation).*
