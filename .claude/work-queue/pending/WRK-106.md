# Hull Panel Geometry Generator from Line Definitions

## What
Build a hull data generator that creates hull panel geometry from line definitions. The generator takes waterline curves, section curves, and profile curves as input and produces panelised hull geometry suitable for diffraction analysis mesh generation. Support parametric hull form creation where hull shapes are defined by engineering line data rather than imported CAD meshes.

## Why
Current hull geometry for diffraction analysis relies on pre-existing meshes or manual CAD exports. A line-based generator enables:
- Rapid parametric hull form creation from standard naval architecture curves
- Hull variation studies without CAD tools (change waterlines/sections programmatically)
- Direct integration with the diffraction analysis pipeline (WRK-031, WRK-043)
- Consistent mesh quality control (panel density, aspect ratio) built into generation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parse hull line definitions: waterline curves, section curves, profile curves
- [ ] Interpolate between defined sections to create full 3D hull surface
- [ ] Panelise hull surface into quad/tri panels suitable for diffraction solvers
- [ ] Support parametric variation of key hull parameters (beam, draft, length, bilge radius, etc.)
- [ ] Control panel density and distribution (finer near waterline, coarser at keel)
- [ ] Output formats compatible with existing mesh-utilities and diffraction pipeline
- [ ] Validate generated geometry: watertight below waterline, correct normals, no degenerate panels
- [ ] Unit tests for standard hull forms (box barge, ship-shaped, semi-submersible pontoon)
- [ ] Documentation with examples showing line input → panel output workflow

## Reference
- WRK-043: Parametric hull form analysis (downstream consumer of generated hulls)
- WRK-031: 3-way benchmark (needs hull geometries as input)
- Existing mesh-utilities skill for mesh operations
