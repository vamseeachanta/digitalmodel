# Introduction

Digital models for engineering assets. The objective of digital models is to utilize a single source of ascii inputs to generate equivalent analytical models to encompass lifecycle operations of a product. 

These operations include (and not limited to) the following:
- Analytical calculations
- Computational analysis
- Compuational 3D animations
