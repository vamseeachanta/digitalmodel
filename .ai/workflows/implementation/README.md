# Implementation Workflows

This directory contains workflows for planning, implementing, and documenting GitHub issues using AI assistants.

## Purpose

Provide structured workflows for AI assistants to:
- Plan implementation for GitHub issues
- Document iterative development process
- Track changes and decisions
- Summarize implementation results
- Maintain traceability from issue to implementation

## Directory Structure

- `issue-planning.md` - Workflow for initial issue analysis and planning
- `implementation-tracking.md` - Process for documenting implementation progress
- `change-documentation.md` - Standards for documenting code changes
- `implementation-summary.md` - Template for summarizing completed work
- `templates/` - Reusable templates for implementation documentation

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Issue Planning Phase
- Analyze GitHub issue requirements
- Create implementation plan
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Estimate effort and timeline

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Document iterative development steps
- Track code changes and decisions
- Handle blockers and scope changes
- Maintain progress visibility

### 3. Documentation Phase
- Summarize implementation approach
- Document key decisions and trade-offs
- Create change summary for review
- Update related documentation

## Integration with Specifications

Implementation workflows integrate with the specification-driven development process:
- Reference relevant specifications from `../../specs/`
- Create new specifications if needed
- Update existing specifications based on implementation learnings
- Maintain bidirectional traceability

## AI Assistant Guidelines

AI assistants should:
1. Follow structured workflows for consistency
2. Document all significant decisions and changes
3. Maintain clear traceability to GitHub issues
4. Use templates for standardized documentation
5. Update workflows based on lessons learned
