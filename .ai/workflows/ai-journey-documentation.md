# AI Implementation Journey Documentation Requirements

For all significant repository changes and feature implementations, AI assistants must add comprehensive AI journey documentation to capture the development process, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Required Documentation Components

### 1. AI Journey Summary (1-2 pages)
Add a detailed "AI Implementation Journey" section to relevant specification files or create dedicated journey documentation that includes:

**Phase-by-Phase Implementation Story**:
- **Phase 1**: Problem analysis and architecture decisions
- **Phase 2**: Technical implementation and core development
- **Phase 3**: Integration and testing strategies
- **Phase 4**: Verification and quality assurance

**Key AI Decision Points and Rationale**:
- Architecture decisions (extension vs. replacement, modular vs. monolithic)
- Implementation approaches (integrated vs. utility methods)
- Testing strategies (mock vs. real data, unit vs. integration)
- Error handling philosophy (strict vs. permissive)

**Development Insights and Best Practices**:
- Code organization patterns and insights
- Technical implementation discoveries
- Integration techniques and patterns
- Testing methodologies and coverage strategies

**Implementation Challenges and AI Solutions**:
- Technical challenges encountered during development
- AI problem-solving approaches and reasoning
- Creative solutions and workarounds implemented
- Risk mitigation strategies employed

### 2. Categorized Lessons Learned
Document lessons in two distinct categories:

**Lessons for Users (Human Developers)**:
- Technical domain insights and expertise gained
- Process improvements and workflow optimizations
- Quality assurance patterns and validation techniques
- Integration strategies and compatibility considerations
- Error handling and user experience improvements

**Lessons for AI Assistants**:
- Effective development patterns and approaches
- Code analysis and understanding techniques
- Testing strategies and validation methods
- Error-driven development and debugging approaches
- Documentation and communication best practices

### 3. Future Application Guidelines
- Reusable patterns established during implementation
- Standards and conventions created or followed
- Quality assurance methodologies validated
- Integration approaches proven effective

## Documentation Placement

**Primary Location**: Add AI journey documentation to the relevant specification file in `.ai/specs/modules/` directory

**Alternative Locations** (if no specification exists):
- Create `ai-journey-[feature-name].md` in `.ai/specs/implementations/`
- Add summary section to relevant module documentation
- Include in project milestone documentation

## Documentation Standards

- **Length**: 1-2 pages (approximately 800-1600 words)
- **Format**: Structured markdown with clear headings and code examples
- **Style**: Professional technical documentation with specific examples
- **Focus**: Balance technical details with process insights
- **Audience**: Both human developers and future AI assistants

## Implementation Triggers

AI journey documentation is required for:
- New feature implementations
- Significant refactoring or restructuring
- Complex bug fixes requiring architectural changes
- Integration of new technologies or patterns
- Performance optimization initiatives
- Security enhancement implementations

## Quality Checklist

Before completing any significant repository change, verify:
- [ ] AI journey summary is complete and follows the required structure
- [ ] Lessons are categorized for both users and AI assistants
- [ ] Decision points include clear rationale and trade-offs
- [ ] Technical challenges and solutions are documented
- [ ] Future application patterns are identified
- [ ] Code examples and implementation details are included
- [ ] Documentation is placed in appropriate location
- [ ] Writing is clear, concise, and technically accurate

## Documentation Template

Use the following template structure for AI journey documentation:

## Example Implementation

See `.ai/specs/modules/user-story-rao-data-import-processing-2025.md` for a complete example of AI journey documentation that follows these requirements.

## Enforcement

This documentation requirement ensures that the valuable insights gained during AI-assisted development are captured, shared, and can benefit future development efforts across the repository. All AI assistants must follow these requirements for significant repository changes.
