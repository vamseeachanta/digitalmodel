## Implementation Tracking Levels

### Epic Level (Months/Quarters)
**Purpose**: Track strategic initiatives spanning multiple features
**Duration**: 2-4 months typically
**Scope**: Major product capabilities or infrastructure improvements

**Key Tracking Elements**:
- Strategic objectives and business outcomes
- Feature breakdown and dependencies
- Resource allocation and timeline
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Stakeholder communication and alignment

### Feature Level (Weeks/Sprints)
**Purpose**: Track deliverable product capabilities
**Duration**: 2-6 weeks typically
**Scope**: Coherent user-facing functionality or technical capabilities

**Key Tracking Elements**:
- User value proposition and acceptance criteria
- User story breakdown and estimation
- Technical architecture and design decisions
- Integration points and dependencies
- Testing strategy and validation approach

### User Story Level (Hours/Days)
**Purpose**: Track individual implementable increments
**Duration**: 1-5 days typically
**Scope**: Single user interaction or technical component

**Key Tracking Elements**:
- Detailed acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Implementation approach and technical decisions
- Code changes and testing coverage
- Issues encountered and resolution
- Lessons learned and improvement opportunities

## File Naming Conventions

### Epic Files
Format: `epic-[descriptive-name].md`
Examples:
- `epic-framework-foundation.md`
- `epic-advanced-catenary-analysis.md`
- `epic-user-experience-redesign.md`

### Feature Files
Format: `feature-[descriptive-name].md`
Examples:
- `feature-requirements-management.md`
- `feature-orcaflex-integration.md`
- `feature-real-time-collaboration.md`

### User Story Files
Format: `story-[descriptive-name].md`
Examples:
- `story-requirements-id-system.md`
- `story-catenary-configuration-ui.md`
- `story-automated-report-generation.md`

## Implementation Workflow Integration

### GitHub Issue Linking
Each implementation file should reference:
- **Primary GitHub Issue**: Main issue being implemented
- **Related Issues**: Dependencies, sub-tasks, or related work
- **Pull Requests**: Code changes implementing the work
- **Specifications**: Relevant specifications from `specs/` directory

### Cross-Reference Standards
```markdown
## GitHub Integration
- **Primary Issue**: #123 - [Issue Title]
- **Related Issues**: #124, #125, #126
- **Pull Requests**: #127, #128
- **Specifications**: `specs/modules/catenary-analysis.md`

## Requirements Traceability
- **Requirements**: R001.2.3 - Advanced catenary configuration
- **Acceptance Criteria**: AC-001.2.3.a through AC-001.2.3.e
- **Validation**: Test cases in `tests/requirements/test_R001_2_3.py`
```

### Status Tracking
Each implementation maintains status through lifecycle:
- **Planning**: Requirements analysis and design
- **In Progress**: Active development and implementation
- **Review**: Code review and quality validation
- **Testing**: User acceptance and integration testing
- **Complete**: Delivered and validated
- **Retrospective**: Lessons learned and process improvement

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Completeness
- [ ] Clear objective and success criteria
- [ ] Detailed implementation approach
- [ ] Technical decisions with rationale
- [ ] Issues encountered and resolution
- [ ] Testing approach and validation
- [ ] Lessons learned and recommendations

### Traceability Requirements
- [ ] Links to GitHub issues and PRs
- [ ] References to relevant specifications
- [ ] Requirements and acceptance criteria mapping
- [ ] Cross-references to related implementations
- [ ] Impact assessment on other components

### Knowledge Capture
- [ ] Technical approaches and alternatives considered
- [ ] Architecture decisions and their rationale
- [ ] Performance implications and optimizations
- [ ] Integration challenges and solutions
- [ ] User feedback and validation results

## Search and Discovery

### Tagging System
Use consistent tags for categorization:
- **Domain**: `offshore-engineering`, `catenary-analysis`, `ship-design`
- **Technology**: `orcaflex`, `ansys`, `python`, `yaml`
- **Type**: `feature`, `enhancement`, `bugfix`, `infrastructure`
- **Complexity**: `simple`, `moderate`, `complex`

### Index Maintenance
Maintain searchable index with:
- Implementation summaries and key outcomes
- Technology and domain associations
- Patterns and reusable approaches
- Common issues and their solutions

## Success Metrics

### Documentation Quality
- **Completeness**: 100% of implementations have required sections
- **Accuracy**: Regular validation against actual implementation
- **Usefulness**: Team members can find and use historical information
- **Timeliness**: Documentation updated within 48 hours of completion

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Searchability**: <30 seconds to find relevant implementation examples
- **Reusability**: 70% of new implementations reference historical patterns
- **Learning**: New team members productive using historical context
- **Decision Support**: Historical data informs current technical decisions

### Process Improvement
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring implementation patterns
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Understand common delays and issues
- **Estimation Accuracy**: Improve future effort estimation
- **Quality Trends**: Track quality improvements over time

## Maintenance and Governance

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Update status of active implementations
- **Quarterly**: Review and summarize completed implementations
- **Annually**: Analyze patterns and update templates
- **As Needed**: Validate accuracy against current codebase

### Archive Management
- **Active**: Current year implementations in main directory
- **Archive**: Previous years moved to archive subdirectories
- **Retention**: Maintain minimum 3 years of implementation history
- **Purging**: Remove obsolete or inaccurate documentation

### Template Evolution
- **Usage Feedback**: Collect team feedback on template effectiveness
- **Process Improvement**: Update templates based on lessons learned
- **Standards Alignment**: Ensure templates align with project standards
- **Tool Integration**: Enhance templates for better tool integration
