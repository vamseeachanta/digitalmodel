- .ai (give as much context into our project to ai-agent as possible)
	- agent-personas
		- assigned-engineer :
			- any time a artifact needs to be updates  (for example.py file), analyze recommend appropriate changes to other supporting artifacts (test cases, test data sets, module specific, product wide documentation, keep mind all personas [.ai/requirements/personas] and identify impacts to all personas that are part of this project )
		- assigned-product-manager
		- assigned-product-owner
	- requirements (assign every element a unique id - e.g. L1-header=section, L2-header= section.subsection and so on)
		- product management - overall purpose, what are the high level functional non functional goals etc  
		- product structure
			- modules - purpose - objectives - features - capabilities etc

		- epic-workflow.md
		- feature-workflow.md
		- userStory-workflow.md - as an assigned-engineer 
			- understand feature as written in gh-issue
			- analyze code + current .ai/requirements
			- recommend changes to be made
			- review with recommendations with lead , get approval
			- implement change, run build pipeline
			- if build pipeline successful generate PR
			- if build pipeline fails 
				- analyze failure
				- share impelmentation + failure analysis 
				- review with lead engineer for next steps 
		- bug-workflow.md 
		- sotu-workflow.md (state of the union)
			- review all codebase outside of .ai 
			- compare the actual code base to the summaries/data in .ai folder for following aspects 
				- does code base still align .ai/requirements sections 
				- does code base still align to
