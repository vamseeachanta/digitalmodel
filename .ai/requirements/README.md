# Requirements Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive requirements documentation for the digitalmodel project, organized hierarchically with unique identifiers for traceability.

## Requirements ID System

### Hierarchical Structure
```
R001          - Top-level requirement (major functional area)
R001.1        - Sub-requirement (specific capability)
R001.1.1      - Detailed requirement (implementation detail)
R001.1.1.a    - Implementation detail (specific constraint)
```

### ID Assignment Rules
- **R### format**: Requirements use "R" prefix followed by zero-padded number
- **Hierarchical numbering**: Sub-requirements extend parent ID
- **Letter suffixes**: Use for implementation details within requirements
- **Sequence integrity**: IDs are sequential within each level
- **Immutable IDs**: Once assigned, IDs are never reused or changed

### Cross-Reference Standards
All requirements must include:
- **Traceability**: Links to related requirements, issues, and implementations
- **Stakeholders**: Who owns and who is affected by the requirement
- **Validation**: How the requirement will be tested and validated
- **Dependencies**: Other requirements or external dependencies
