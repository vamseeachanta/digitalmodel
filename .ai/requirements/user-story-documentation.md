### R022 - File Organization Requirements
User story files must follow repository organization standards.

#### R022.1 - Location Standards
- R022.1.1: User stories must be placed in `.ai/specs/modules/` directory

- R023.2.1: AI journey documentation must be complete
- R023.2.2: Actual implementation must match documented approach
- R023.2.3: Lessons learned must be captured accurately

### R024 - Maintenance Requirements
User story documentation must be maintained throughout lifecycle.

#### R024.1 - Update Requirements
- R024.1.1: File references must be updated when files move
- R024.1.2: Implementation details must reflect actual code
