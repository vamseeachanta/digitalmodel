## User Experience Implementation

### Persona Interaction Framework
Created comprehensive interaction matrix showing how personas collaborate:

| From/To | Engineer | Product Manager | Product Owner |
|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Engineer** | Code reviews | Implementation feasibility | Technical constraints |
| **Product Manager** | Requirements clarification | Strategy alignment | Business requirements |
| **Product Owner** | Acceptance criteria | User needs | Story refinement |

### Cross-Persona Impact Analysis
Established systematic approach for analyzing impacts:
1. **Code Changes** → Engineer analyzes test coverage, PM assesses timeline, PO validates user impact
2. **Requirements Changes** → PM evaluates scope, Engineer assesses complexity, PO validates user value
3. **Process Changes** → All personas analyze impact on their workflows and quality gates

### Quality Gates by Persona
Defined specific quality standards for each persona:
- **Engineering**: Code standards, test coverage, documentation completeness
- **Product Management**: Requirements clarity, stakeholder alignment, success metrics
- **Product Owner**: Story quality (INVEST criteria), acceptance criteria, user value validation

## Testing and Validation
