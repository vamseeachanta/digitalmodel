# User Story: Speed Up AI Assistant with Indexing Tools

## Title
As a developer, I want to implement indexing tools like Serena MCP to speed up AI assistant code navigation and search operations

## User Story
**As a** developer using AI assistants in this codebase  
**I want** to integrate indexing tools such as Serena MCP  
**So that** the AI assistant can quickly search, navigate, and understand the codebase without repeatedly scanning files

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Serena MCP or similar indexing tool is configured for the repository
- [ ] AI assistant can leverage pre-built indexes for file search operations
- [ ] Code symbol search (functions, classes, variables) is accelerated through indexing
- [ ] Index updates automatically when files change
- [ ] AI assistant response time for code navigation queries improves by at least 50%
- [ ] Documentation exists for maintaining and updating the indexing configuration

## Technical Details
- Implement Serena MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for codebase indexing
- Configure index to include all relevant file types (.py, .js, .ts, .md, etc.)
- Set up automatic index refresh on file changes
- Ensure AI assistant can query the index efficiently

## Benefits
- Faster AI assistant responses for code search and navigation
- Reduced token usage by avoiding repetitive file scanning
- Better context awareness through pre-indexed relationships
- Improved developer productivity with quicker AI-assisted code exploration

## Priority
High - Performance improvement directly impacts developer experience

## Estimated Effort
Medium - Initial setup and configuration with ongoing maintenance
