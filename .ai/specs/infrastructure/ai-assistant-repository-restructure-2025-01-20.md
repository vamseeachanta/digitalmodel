- Lack of standardized development process
- No formal specification workflow
- Limited automation for common tasks
- Inconsistent documentation structure

### Limitations
- Manual specification creation
- No template standardization
- Unclear AI assistant permissions and guidelines
- No automated validation of specifications

## Proposed Solution

### Solution Overview

3. Automated tooling for AI assistants
4. Clear project context and guidelines
5. Standardized development workflows

### Technical Details
- Restructure .ai folder with modular guidance

## Original Prompt

This specification was created in response to the following user request:

```
rewrite CLAUDE.md to be more ai assistant generic
rewrite content to .ai folder in repository
claude to change folder structure, file names and make improvements and additions as required for specification driven development
add this prompt as specification to repository specs directory. create folder and associated structure as necessary
```

The implementation successfully addresses all aspects of this request by:
1. Making CLAUDE.md more generic for all AI assistants
2. Creating a comprehensive .ai folder structure
3. Establishing specification-driven development infrastructure
4. Adding this prompt as a formal specification in the specs directory
5. Creating all necessary folder structures and templates
