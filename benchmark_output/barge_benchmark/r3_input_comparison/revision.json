  "description": "r3: Extended input comparison table with geometry (L/B/T), mass properties (mass, CoG, radii of gyration), environment (water density, gravity), mesh details, and solver settings. Phase convention and M24 fixes carried forward from r2.",
  "changes": [
    "Input comparison table: added geometry, mass, environment sections",
    "Metadata loaded from barge_benchmark_spec.yml",
    "solver_metadata plumbed through BenchmarkRunner to BenchmarkPlotter",
    "Carried forward: phase negation, M24/M42 coupling fix from r2"
